Trains were temporarily suspended due to the quake and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg confirmed the suspension bridges in the city were checked for damage . The 5 . 9 - magnitude tremor struck at about 2pm local time with shallow tremors of about 3 . 7 miles deep , which is thought to explain why the shaking was so widespread . The U . S . Geological Survey said the earthquake was half a mile deep and centred near Louisa , Virginia , about 40 miles north west of Richmond .
