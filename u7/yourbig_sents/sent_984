Even at a relatively high transport velocity of 1 ft / day - and assuming that groundwater flows in a straight line eastward from the fracking operation ( which it doesn ' t ) and that the intervening rock strata are perfectly homogenous ( which they aren ' t )- it would take 475 , 200 days (~ 1 , 302 yrs ) for injected fracking fluid to reach the known epicenter .
