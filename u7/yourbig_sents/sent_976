It is doubtful that fracking injection would contribute enough fluid and energy needed to create the seismic activity necessary to generate a 5 . 8 - 5 . 9 magnitude earthquake that would be felt along a significant portion of North America . Please check the USGS website and examine the focal mechanism solution , which indicates reverse - oblique slipping along the nearby Spotsylvania Fault .
