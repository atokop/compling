Homeless China quake survivors face fragile future By Neil Connor ( AFP ) – 4 days ago LUSHAN , China — Tens of thousands of homeless survivors of China ' s devastating quake are living in makeshift tents or on the streets , facing shortages of food and supplies as well as an uncertain future . Saturday ' s disaster has left at least 193 dead , 25 missing and more than 12 , 000 injured , and forced the evacuation of some 245 , 000 people in Sichuan province in China ' s mountainous southwest , according to Chinese and UN data . Along Chonglu Road , which cuts through the heart of the worst - affected area in Sichuan ' s Lushan county , hundreds of tents have been erected in front of piles of debris that were once orderly rows of homes . Many of the displaced headed for the relative safety of Lushan ' s densely populated centre , spending their nights outdoors in sleeping bags on the grassy mounds surrounding Lushan People ' s Hospital . But others have not left the rubble where their destroyed homes once stood , and instead sleep in tents they have erected themselves by using sticks and canvas , or in bright blue shelters provided by relief agencies . An elderly woman from the devastated village of Longmen sat forlornly in front of a pile of debris , and shrugged when asked where she was going to shelter that night as rain started to pour .
