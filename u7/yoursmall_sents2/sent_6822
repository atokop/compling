As of 4 : 30 p . m . local time Sunday , the Chinese air force had sent 106 planes for rescue missions , including personnel and material transportation , Xinhua said . An emergency rescue team with 200 workers organized by the China Earthquake Administration ( CEA ), joined their provincial counterparts in the quake zone Sunday afternoon , but bad weather delayed plans to reach hard - hit Baoxing County , which has had little contact with the outside world , according to the CEA . Chinese Premier Li Keqiang visited injured survivors Sunday before returning to Beijing , where Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said China does not currently need foreign rescue teams or medical and relief supplies .
