Sahaj castled on the queenside and started a solid attack of pawns on the Prasanna ' s king . In the middle game Prasanna got a central passed pawn but it was captured by Sahaj with exchange of rooks , which helped him gain a clear advantage , but he failed to capitalise on it . In the end , with opposite coloured bishops on the board , the game headed towards a draw before Prasanna sacrificed his bishop for a passed pawn , getting two passed pawns against the bishop , and winning in 76 moves .
