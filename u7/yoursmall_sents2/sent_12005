Searching through google i opened India - forums for the first time .. I got the news that hussain will continue doing the show and i was really happy .. I was totally new to India - forums and did not know that one has to become a member to use it .. I was impressed by the discussion of the members regarding serial and also reading the previous articles posted in India - forums earlier ... Initially i did not know much but at least once in a day i would open this site and see the updates and other information .. Slowly i came to know about other sections , fan clubs , chat clubs etc etc .. Even then i had not joined it becauz i feared becoming member in any site .. I remained as silent member for about 6 months .. And then on March 9 , 2007 .. I registered here and that was the first time i ever became member of any discussion or chat site becauz i trusted this site ...
