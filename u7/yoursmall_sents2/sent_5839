The State Council , or Cabinet , issued a notice Monday asking volunteers , tourists and others not trained as rescuers to stay out of the disaster area . At the Lushan county seat , tents have been set up on open spaces , and volunteers doled out noodles and boxed meals to survivors from stalls and the backs of vans . A large van with a convertible side served as a mobile bank with an ATM , military medical trucks provided X - rays for people with minor injuries , and military doctors administered basic first aid , applying iodine solution to cuts and examining bruises . Patients with minor ailments were lying in tents in the yard of the hospital , which was wrecked by the quake , with the most severely injured patients sent to the provincial capital .
