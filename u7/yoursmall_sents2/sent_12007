I could pass my time easily .. I had become addicted to india - forums ... Later i became so addicted that i felt restless if i did not get to open India - forums once in a day .. So atleast once i open India - forums even today .. I came to know many many things about my favourite stars and it is only India forums due to which i know about my favourite Stars ... As i came in contact with other members .. I became more friendly with them and all of them were very helpful . India - forums gave me some of the best Net friends i could have found ever ... From newbie to senior member and then to Coolbie and i luved giving updates and also gave updates for few months ..
