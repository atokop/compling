The 6 . 6 magnitude quake struck in Lushan county , near the city of Ya ' an in the southwestern province of Sichuan , close to where a devastating 7 . 9 quake hit in May 2008 , killing 70 , 000 . Most of the deaths were concentrated in Lushan , a short drive up the valley from Ya ' an , but rescuers ' progress was hampered by the narrowness of the road and landslides , as well as government controls restricting access to avoid traffic jams .
