Coming from southern CA , we ’ re pretty apathetic about earthquakes for the most part ( last large one , they paused the ball game to the cheer of the crowd ) – but , I do understand it was probably a bit of a shock for that region – can be pretty frightful for someone who has never felt one before ( my boyfriend grew up in germany , and is pretty unnerved by the idea of the ground moving lol ).
