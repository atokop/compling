But it is a matter related to Dempo only and not the national team ," said Das . Colaco has had a decent four - month stint as national coach with one win , two draws and three losses in the international matches India had played during the time . Another important issue that would come up in Thursday ' s meeting is the appointment of technical director who will oversee the overall development of Indian football . Dutchman Robert Baan is reportedly the frontrunner for the top job with his vast experience at the international level in many countries , but sources said that nothing has been finalised yet and the executive committee will discuss it threadbare . The date of start of I - League and the broadcaster of the tournament will also be discussed tomorrow . The AIFF was initially thinking of starting the I - League in late October , but it can also be advanced by some days . The question of live telecast of the I - League has become important as the commercial partner of the AIFF , the International Management Group , has not been able to find an official broadcast partner nine months after it signed a Rs 700 crore deal with the federation last December . The ongoing Federation Cup in Kolkata and Pune is being telecast only in Bengal and Assam through local channels though the Doordarshan has agreed to show some matches â€“ the quarterfinals , semifinals and the final in all likelyhood .
