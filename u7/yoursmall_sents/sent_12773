New Delhi : A section of the All Indian Football Federation is likely to strongly oppose the extension of national coach Armando Colaco ' s contract when the matter comes up for discussion in a crucial executive committee meeting here on Thursday . Armando ' s four - month contract will expire later this month and though he had expressed his willingness to continue provided the federation wants him , a powerful lobby within the AIFF is against the Goan . Sources in the AIFF said that the cancellation of India ' s international friendly against Barbados in the Caribbean tour last month and Dempo ' s signing of Trinidad and Tobago international Denzil Theobald , who was in the 2006 World Cup squad , have angered a section of the federation top brass . Sources said that some top officials are under the impression that Armando was doubling up as national coach as well as Dempo scout during the tour of the Caribbean . It must be noted that Armando , besides coaching Dempo for many years , is also the club ' s general secretary . There is a strong possibility of some executive committee members raising the issue on Thursday .
