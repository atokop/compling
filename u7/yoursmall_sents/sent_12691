" Some people still call alleged 2G scam ," the bench said . Venugopal then replied " I call it 2G scam as the charge sheet has been filed in the case ". The court made the remarks during the hearing of Janata Party President Subramanian Swamy ' s plea seeking a CBI probe against Home Minister P Chidambaram for his alleged culpability in 2G scam . Swamy alleged Chidambaram as the then Finance Minister was party to a conspiracy with Raja in deciding the price for spectrum , which was contested by CBI and the Centre . CBI and the Centre opposed Swamy ' s plea saying it is beyond the Supreme Court ' s jurisdiction to decide as the probe into the multi - crore scam was complete and only the trial court can entertain such a petition .
