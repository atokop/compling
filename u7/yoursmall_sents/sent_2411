Sunday , April 21 , 2013 Share | | Some facts about China  s quake zone BEIJING : The area of southwestern China struck by a violent tremor on Saturday has witnessed some of the world  s deadliest earthquakes . The area sits on the boundary between two of the Earth  s tectonic plates , the Indian and Asian plates , which are constantly grinding against each other . The region is unusual geologically because of the steep slopes at the boundary between the Sichuan Basin and the Tibetan plateau , according to seismologists . The elevation rises by about 11 , 500 feet over only about 50 kilometres . Earthquakes are frequent along the fringes of the Tibetan plateau , which was raised when India collided into Eurasia starting some 50 million years ago . It is this powerful thrust that created the Himalayas and its highest peak , Mount Everest , which reaches 8 , 848 metres ( 29 , 029 feet ).
