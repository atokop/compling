An not propagating American tv as the final test of excellence ( they have their own share of crappy stuff ) but if we just incorporate their respect for writers ( remember the Hollywood tv writer ' s strike ) then television will surely get the direction it badly needs . Having said that I must say that the response to my show across the world has been quite overwhelming .
