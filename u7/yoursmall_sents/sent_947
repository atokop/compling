People in their underwear and wrapped in blankets ran into the streets of Ya ' an and even the provincial capital of Chengdu , 115 kilometers ( 70 miles ) east of Lushan , according to photos , video and accounts posted online . The quake ' s shallow depth , less than 13 kilometers ( 8 miles ), likely magnified the impact . Chengdu ' s airport shut down for about an hour before reopening , though many flights were canceled or delayed , and its railway station halted dozens of scheduled train rides Saturday , state media said . Lushan reported the most deaths , 76 , but there was concern that casualties in neighboring Baoxing county might have been under - reported because of inaccessibility after roads were blocked and power and phone services cut off . As the region went into the first night after the quake , rain started to fall , slowing rescue work .
