I have always been open to criticism in regards to all my shows ; all comments are welcome because creativity is not rocket science , it always has two points of views some agree and some don ' t which is justified as every individual is different and has the freedom of speech , I respect all the strong reactions that I come across on the blog and I do know that it is only because of the fact that you all have connected to the shows in a very short span of time however it is very funny to see that one negative comment on the blog each time , which has got nothing to do with my shows but is more of a personal attack to me , such people are not welcome here , please find your own ways and means to vent out your frustrations .
