Spokesman Lv Dapeng said a pipeline that supplies gas from the field , one of China ' s largest , to the city of Shanghai was also functioning normally , as were its service stations in the region . The company had prepared reserves of fuel to help with relief efforts , Lv said . Sichuan is one of the four major natural - gas - producing provinces in China , and its output accounts for about 14 percent of the nation ' s total . China ' s top oil company , PetroChina , which also has oil and gas production facilities in the province , could not immediately be reached for comment . The firm has said that it plans to start a trial run of its 200 , 000 barrels - per - day Pengzhou refinery in Sichuan this month . Construction of the plant , the largest refining and chemical complex in southwestern China , was briefly halted in 2008 after an earthquake that killed some 70 , 000 . On Saturday , a 6 . 6 magnitude earthquake hit the province killing at least 28 people and injuring at least 100 .
