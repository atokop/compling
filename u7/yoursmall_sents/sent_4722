" The rescue and relief effort has been hampered by the region ' s forbidding landscape , with high - altitude roads blocked by boulders and landslides and emergency workers in fear of further sudden slippages . The People ' s Liberation Army has used helicopters to airdrop supplies including bottled water and instant noodles to survivors in Lushan , the official Xinhua news agency reported . But state - run media have reported severe shortages of essential goods in many of the affected counties that together with Lushan lie within Ya ' an city . China News Service said that in Tianquan county , victims are in desperate need of water , food , quilts and medicine . And Beijing News reported that neighbouring Baoxing county was also suffering from a shortage of tents .
