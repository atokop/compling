Colombo : Sri Lanka Cricket on Wednesday named a strong 15 - men squad for the tour of Pakistan , scheduled to be held in the United Arab Emirates , their off - shore venue . The three Test matches will be played in Abu Dhabi , Dubai and Sharjah . Kaushal Silva , the wicket - keeper batsman , is the only uncapped player in the squad , while there was no place for Ajantha Mendis , who is nursing an injury . This will be Pakistan ` s first home series against the islanders after the March 2009 Lahore terrorist attack on the Lankan team bus . Tillakaratne Dilshan , who reportedly saved the Sri Lankan team from a major tragedy by urging the bus driver to accelarate in the face of the attack , will be leading the team in his second overseas stint as captain . The glaring omission is middle - order batsman Thilan Samaraweera , who was one of the six cricketers injured in the attack . Samaraweera was axed for the final Test against Australia this week as the selectors opted to groom opening batsman , Lahiru Thirimanna , allowing Dilshan to bat down the order . Rangana Herath , the left - arm spinner and off - spinner Suraj Randiv , are the two slow bowlers in the side along with Nuwan Pradeep , the right - arm medium pacer who returns to form a five - men pace attack . Pradeep , a find from a TV cricket talent contest , came back due to injury half way through the England tour in May .
