The full extent of damage was not immediately known because the region is sparsely populated with many people living in remote areas now cut off by mudslides triggered by the quake , Sikkim police chief Jasbir Singh said . The powerful earthquake with a 6 . 8 magnitude hit Sikkim and several areas in the eastern part of the country and neighbouring Nepal on Sunday , leaving several dead and injuring more than 100 while causing extensive damage to buildings and roads . The epicentre of the quake — the biggest in two decades — was located at Mangan and Sakyong areas , over 50 km from Gangtok on the Sikkim - Nepal border .
