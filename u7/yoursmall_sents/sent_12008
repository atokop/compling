The journey is fantastic and every moment is filled with memories .. Teasing friends .. online parties searching madly for videos .. all r such moments which i cant forget ... I also made lots of Good friends through my journey which inlcude Nandini , Marium , Shilpa , Nitya , Ekta , Ankita , Resham , Rahilla , Surakshita , Norzar ... who were very helpful and are very dear to me now ... Also i got few nick names like AG , Dreaming girl , Seemo etc ... Another great section is of Avtar and signature shop .. from where i came to learn about making sigges and avis and video - mixes .. I really enjoyed making sigges and all ... I have taken tutions of this from my many friends ... Making fan - fics and writing stories with all imagination was another funny part .. Grilling members ie making member of the week was also fun .. Also many celebs r part of this forum and i am happy to interact with some of them like IIra soni , Snighda , Megha gupta , Priya ahuja .. India - forums has changed a lot since when i joined here .
