The death toll in China ' s worst earthquake in three years stands at more than 200 , with almost 12 , 000 people injured . Ongoing aftershocks are causing major landslides in the earthquake disaster zone , and falling rocks continue to block entry into some of the worst hit areas . Most of the deaths have been concentrated in Lushan , a short drive up the valley from the city of Ya ' an , but rescuers ' progress has been hampered by the narrowness of the road and landslides , as well as government controls restricting access to avoid traffic jams . Rescue teams are queuing up and waiting to reach isolated towns and some communities are still only accessible by helicopter . Firefighters helped by sniffer dogs have pulled 91 people alive from the rubble .
