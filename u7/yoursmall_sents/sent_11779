Face Book Home Whiplash Posted On : 15 September 2011 at 12 : 00am Comment : 29 | View : 1626 Hello everybody ... Am blown away by the number of comments I have been getting .. The love that I am receiving makes me feel special and love is the drug that makes the world go round .. So i am posting a new poem that I have written for all the lovers out there who pine for each other , desire each other and have such strong passions that every moment spent together becomes private , almost like a secret .. like something that must be safeguarded from the world ... My poem is called WhiplashCan I hold your hand ? While we stand here in the sandThe little waves touching our curled toes .
