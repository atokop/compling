@TheDuckseason
Is Duckseason a Government shill? No data, just personal attacks. Duckseason, if you want to convince anyone of anything, BRING FACTS AND DATA. If you don't, your credibility﻿ when you do bring data will already be damaged. Right now, nobody has any reason to believe a word you say.

I hate people . I cant believe you people believe this﻿ shit. " I am in North Dakota and my mobile on my ceiling moved" Thats what they do!!!!! No one felt shit in ND. Earthquakes of this size have occured many times in Va . last one in 1897 or something, before anything Nuclear.

im 50/50 on this one, explosion, maybe, nuke, probably not.
The medical effects of a nuclear blast upon humans:
Initial stage -- the first 1–2 weeks, in which are the greatest number of deaths, with 90% due to thermal injury and/or blast effects and 10% due to super-lethal radiation﻿ exposure...... Why no one dead or even sick??? So great vid, but can't be a nuke.

If the earthquake's seismograph is more similar to underground nuclear explosion then it means that the nuclear device had detonated underground and had caused an earthquake. Simple. So why run your mouth and state otherwise especially if﻿ you do not know what seismograph is.

@MrFranky277 If they did build a Nuclear site on a fault,then they should be classed as idiots and terrorists,im not a specialist in nuclear energy,but when it comes to designing and building something like that, i would place it on solid ground,but its hard﻿ to say,the epicenter is very unusual for virginia

And yes they debated for years here in Va about building that nuclear plant on the fault line before it was built many﻿ years ago.

@thedood73 well in this case the doors are said to have been opened releasing that strange sound... So would that have not﻿ released the radiation above ground?

@EarthquakeReporter its a deep under ground contained blast. the only casultiees from the explosion are likely to be underground. it,ll﻿ take a while to notice effects above. a lot of nuclear testing in the past was done underground.
