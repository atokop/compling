TEN YEARS OF WAR
Date:  Thursday, September 8, 2011 | 6pm

The tragic events of September 11, 2001, which claimed many lives in the United States, have since given rise to an era of endless US/NATO-sponsored wars accompanied by economic chaos, rising poverty and financial manipulation. We have seen a marked shift towards authoritarianism, the criminalization of justice and the development of a police state. At this special 10 year commemorative event, we invite the public to an evening exploring the truth behind 9/11 and its implications for the future of society.
