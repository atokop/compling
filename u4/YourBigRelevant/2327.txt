Twitter Reaction to Earthquake Comes to Life on Animated Map [VIDEO]

Eric Fischer created this fascinating animation, showing what an earthquake looks like through the lens of Twitter. It’s a tweetquake!
Key: Green dots are tweets about the earthquake, and gray dots are tweets about anything else. The video covers 12 minutes with each frame of the video representing one second in real time.
Fischer says in his Flickr comments that he only included tweets with geotags, so this represents just a fraction of the earthquake-related tweets sent on Tuesday when the quake shook up the eastern seaboard. 
Let’s hope Fischer fires up his Twitter animation routine for the looming Hurricane Irene, which is sure to light up the map, whether it makes landfall or not.

Pretty cool. I’ll admit, I have a Facebook status at 1:51, the moment the quake started, that says Wow! Earthquake. Then I Tweeted :p

What I think you don’t understand is an earthquake of this magnitude in this area of the US is such a rarity that most people in the eastern seaboard will never feel one anywhere near this strong again in their lives.  It’s kind of like getting snow in Miami, if you know what I mean.

This is the kind of technology we need to see more of!
Twitter is fast becoming the news desk of the world and it is very handy to see how people react in times of urgency. It would be very interesting to see how he has gathered this information!

Fantastically done video! 
But hopefully when there’s an earthquake, the first thing people will do is to find a safe place rather than to look for their phones/iPads to tweet about what’s happening. “Be safe,tweet later…” #DamnItsTrue
