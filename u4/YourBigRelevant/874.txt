Is China Planning a Surprise Missile Attack?







by Gordon G. Chang / Around Asia

A retired Chinese general recently revealed that his country might be planning a surprise missile attack on the United States. The public comment of Xu Guangyu came in response to WikiLeaks revelations that last year Washington had warned its allies beforehand of China’s test of a missile interceptor.

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, in a classified cable sent last January 9th, instructed American embassies in Australia, Britain, Canada, and New Zealand to notify those countries of upcoming Chinese launches two days later. The cable included details of the launch sites for the interceptor and the target, the models of the missiles, the purpose of the test, and the test date.

Yesterday, Hong Kong’s South China Morning Post carried comments from Xu, now at the China Arms Control and Disarmament Association, to the effect that American satellites would have detected activity at the launch sites but that some of the information in the cables—specifically the types of missiles and the day of the test—must have come from a source on the ground. WikiLeaks’s release of this cable, revealing one or more American spies in China’s strategic missile corps, is perhaps the website’s most significant compromise of US security to date. 

The Hong Kong paper noted that Xu said that “if China could no longer keep secret its missile launches, it would not be able to launch a surprise attack on the US.”

Is China really in the process of planning to destroy the American homeland with a preemptive barrage of nuclear-tipped missiles? Xu’s comment, of course, is not proof, but it does reveal that Chinese flag officers are thinking about doing so.

Unfortunately, Xu’s hostile sentiment fits within a worrisome trend. Especially since the beginning of last year, there has been a series of belligerent comments from China’s generals, admirals, and colonels, some talking about war with the US in the near future. Last February, for instance, Colonel Meng Xianging said the People’s Liberation Army would “qualitatively upgrade” its capabilities to force a showdown on US policy toward Taiwan within the decade “when we’re strong enough for a hand-to-hand fight with the US.”

Given the belicose statements coming from some of China’s military brass—along with China’s well-documented aggressive behavior in the South China Sea and other peripheral waters—it is difficult to imagine how Western observers can deny China’s intentions and the clashes that lie ahead. Thank you, General Xu.

Laser beams could be used to create rain








Firing laser beams into humid air could give scientists control over when and where rain falls, a new study claims

By Nick Collins, Science Correspondent

Researchers from the University of Geneva used lasers to create water droplets in the air, in a development which could eventually lead to man-made weather systems. 

Although the technique, known as laser-assisted water condensation, does not work in dry air scientists were able to generate the droplets in very humid conditions over the Rhône river in Switzerland. 

The drops created – just thousandths of a millimetre across – were nowhere near heavy enough to fall as rain but the experts hope that by making them hundreds of times larger they will be able to create or prevent rainfall in the right conditions. 

The method works by firing laser beams into the air, creating nitric acid particles which draw water molecules together and stop them from evaporating, according to a study in the Nature Communications journal. 

If the process is repeated in air currents that are blowing towards mountains, the researchers hope the air will cool enough that the droplets grow large enough to fall as rain.

Sony unveils world's first 3D head-mounted display that is as immersive as 'sitting in a cinema'








The HMZ device enables the wearer to experience cinema-like viewing, equivalent to watching a 750-inch screen from 20 metres away

By Graham Smith

Technology giant Sony has unveiled a head-mounted display that takes the wearer into a 3D cinema of videos, music and games.

The HMZ personal 3D viewer is being targetted at people who prefer solitary entertainment rather than sitting in front of a television with family or friends.

Resembling a futuristic visor, the £480 ($800) device is worn like a pair of chunky goggles and earphones in one.

The HMZ - which stands for head-mounted display - displays footage that is crystal clear.

It is equipped with two 0.7in high definition organic light emitting diode (OLED) panels and 5.1 channel dynamic audio headphone.

The gadget enables the wearer to experience cinema-like viewing, equivalent to watching a 750-inch screen from 20 metres away, 

The music video on display at a Sony showcase for reporters in Tokyo was of a Japanese singer and was so clear that it felt like peering into a dolls house in which a real-life tiny singer is moving.

It seems unlikely that most people - or even technology enthusiasts - will want to buy a product that involves sitting alone and wearing a little helmet.

For this reason, the HMZ might not be Sony's long-awaited answer to Apple's iPod or iPad, but just another quirky device packed with cutting-edge technology that is headed for a limited niche following.

Nintendo's Virtual Boy, a 3-D wearable gaming machine that went on sale in the 1990s, bombed, partly because of the bulky headgear required as well as the image being all red.

Sony's latest product is far more sophisticated, delivering an experience that is as immersive as sitting in one of the best seats in a cinema.

It is not recommended for people 15 years old and younger because some experts believe overly stimulating imagery is not good for teenagers whose brains are still developing, according to Shigeru Kato, a Sony vice president.

On the plus side, consumers are growing more accustomed to 3D these days, with the arrival of 3D TVs and game machines.

The HMZ uses Sony's own OLED screen, a relatively new kind of display that relays superb image quality and colour, compared to the more prevalent liquid crystal and plasma displays used in laptops and flat-panel TVs.

Mr Kato said the major challenge had been making a very small display without compromising image quality.

The HMZ is set to go on sale in Japan on November 11; a U.S. and European release could come as early as Christmas.

Ahmadinejad: Iran is determined to eradicate Israel







Iranian president says those who are for humanity should also be for eradicating Israel, since the 'Zionist regime is a symbol of suppression and discrimination.'

By DPA 

Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said that Iran was determined to eradicate Israel, ISNA news agency reported Thursday. 

"Iran believes that whoever is for humanity should also be for eradicating the Zionist regime (Israel) as symbol of suppression and discrimination," Ahmadinejad said in an interview with a Lebanese television network, carried by ISNA. 

"Iran follows this issue (the eradication of Israel) with determination and decisiveness and will never ever withdraw from this standpoint and policy," the Iranian president added in the interview with the Al-Manar network. 

The remarks by Ahmadinejad came one day before the annual anti-Israeli rallies named Qods (Jerusalem) Day, which are held nationwide in Iran on the last Friday of the fasting month of Ramadan. 

Ahmadinejad on Monday said that Iranians and Muslim nations worldwide should hold Qods rallies and show their willingness to dispose of this "infectious tumor and this regime full of rascality." 

The Iranian president provoked international condemnation in 2005 when he said that Israel should be eliminated from the map of the Middle East and transferred to Europe or North America.

Hospital patients now being microchipped with "electronic tattoos"








by: Christina Luisa / natural news

(NaturalNews) Being microchipped is now being spun as a method of protecting the health of hospital patients. To help mask the practice of this bodily invasion with a trendy, high-tech appearance, microchipping sensors are being referred to as "electronic tattoos" that can attach to human skin and stretch and move without breaking.

Supposedly the comparisons of this hair-thin electronic patch-like chip to an electronic tattoo are being made because of how it adheres to the skin like a temporary tattoo using only water.

The small chip is less than 50 micrometers thick, which is thinner in diameter than a human hair. It is being marketed as a "safe" and easy way to temporarily monitor the heart and brain in patients while replacing bulky medical equipment currently being used in hospitals.

This device uses micro-electronics technology called an epidermal electronic system (EES) and is said to be a development that will "transform" medical sensing technology, computer gaming and even spy operations, according to a study published last week.

The hair-thin chip was developed by an international team of researchers from the United States, China and Singapore and is described in the Journal of Science.

The proven link between animal microchipping and cancer

Pet microchips have become increasingly common over the past few years. These chips are marked with a small barcode that can be scanned just like the tags on grocery items.

This seems to suggest that microchips are meant to turn the wearer into an object that can be tracked and catalogued. Once inserted in an animal, the chip stays there for the entirety of its lifetime and can be used to identify the pet if it should be found on the street or turned into a shelter. The subdermal chips are often recommended by vets and animal care experts as a way to ensure lost pets find their way home again.

But research suggests that despite their proclaimed usefulness, pet microchips may cause cancer. Multiple studies have clearly linked pet microchips with increased incidence of cancer and tumors in mice and rats.

In the past, public disclosure of these suggested links between microchipping and cancer in animals stirred widespread concern over the safety of implantable microchips in living beings. The animal microchip study findings that created such an uproar were so persuasive that Dr. Robert Benezra, head of the Cancer Biology Genetics Program at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, was quoted in an article about microchipping as saying, "There's no way in the world, having read this information, that I would have one of those chips implanted in my skin, or in one of my family members."

A 2001 study found that 1% of rats with implanted microchips developed cancerous tumors near the chip location. At least a dozen animal studies have been done between 1990 and 2007 and most concluded that microchips significantly increased the risk of cancer at the microchip site.

Soon we'll all have "cool electronic tattoos!"

All the electronic parts of the new EES chip are built out of wavy, snake-like components which allow them to be stretched and squeezed. They also contain tiny solar cells which can generate power or get energy from electromagnetic radiation. The sensor is mounted on to a water-soluble sheet of plastic and attached to the body by brushing the surface with water - hence the comparison to a temporary tattoo.

This new device being implanted in hospital patients certainly looks and acts like a microchip - yet it is persistently being referred to as an "electronic tattoo" in order to make the concept appear harmless, friendly - even trendy!

Invasive microchips - is the cost worth the convenience?

Scientists claim the supposed advantage of the EES chips is their ability to cut back on the bevy of wires, gel-coated sticky pads and monitors that are currently relied on to keep track of the vital signs of hospital patients. Apparently these traditional forms of bulky equipment and monitors are overly "distressing" to patients.

It appears scientists believe these new microchips are convenient enough that they outweigh the potential risks.

In test trials, the microchip was purposefully attached to the throat of a human and used to detect differences in words such as up, down, left, right, go and stop. Researchers used these functions to control a simple computer game.

Is the convenience of not having to manually operate equipment great enough to justify the implantation of an electronic sensor beneath the skin of humans? Would you trust a microchip to monitor your bodily functions without causing health hazards in the process?

The future of America: microchipped zombies

Researchers believe the technology could be used to replace traditional wires and cables, but this sounds remarkably like an excuse used to cover up the real truth: that this new microchipping method is a way to ensure all of us are eventually microchipped and able to be tracked and monitored. Soon, everyone will be required to wear chips or "tattoos" that prove they got their vaccinations, to link to health records, credit history and social security records.

If the government can require Americans to carry microchipped documents including your work, financial and health records, it seems it is only a matter of time before these chips will be implanted for the sake of "convenience" or "security." According to them, all of this is being done "for our own good."

Tim Cook has become world's most powerful gay man







By Sarah O'Carroll, Business Editor / news.com.au 

NON-inclusive workplaces and a lack of role models are two of the biggest challenges for gay people looking to get ahead in the corporate world. 

Not for too much longer, hope diversity activists, following the appointment of Tim Cook as CEO of Apple.

Cook's rise to the top of the most valuable company in the world could well mean he has become the world's most powerful gay man.

Cook, who had been notoriously silent on his sexuality before being outed as gay earlier this year by tech media, was ranked number one in Out magazine’s Power 50 index in May, taking over the top spot from US talk show host Ellen Degeneres.

The 50-year-old engineer was noted as a "leader-in-waiting" after taking the CEO reins on numerous occasions while Jobs was on sick leave.

He joined Apple in 1998 and served as Chief Operating Officer responsible for the company's worldwide sales and operations.

He has been described in the past as the genius behind Jobs and a key to the success of Apple's operations. He will now be hailed as a role model for gay people in the corporate world.

"I think that it's a fantastic development," said Nareen Young, CEO of Diversity Council of Australia.

"What it reinforces is that gay and lesbian people are everywhere and the fact that they have are reaching the senior echelons of business is an achievement."

She added: "While there are a lot of role models out there, having a gay person at the helm of one of the world’s biggest companies might encourage people to come out who haven’t felt comfortable doing so in the past,” said Young.

Rodney Croome, spokesman of Australian Marriage Equality, said: “There are still many gay and lesbian people at high levels of the corporate world who are afraid to come out. Cook's appointment will help open the corporate closet."

When Cook arrived at Apple he was instructed with the task of cleaning up the manufacturing, distribution and global supply system.

Before Apple, he was vice president of Corporate Materials for Compaq and also spend 12 years with IBM which was named as Australia’s most gay-friendly employer at an awards ceremony in May.

Market crash 'could hit within weeks', warn bankers








A more severe crash than the one triggered by the collapse of Lehman Brothers could be on the way, according to alarm signals in the credit markets. 

By Harry Wilson, and Philip Aldrick

Insurance on the debt of several major European banks has now hit historic levels, higher even than those recorded during financial crisis caused by the US financial group's implosion nearly three years ago. 

Credit default swaps on the bonds of Royal Bank of Scotland, BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank and Intesa Sanpaolo, among others, flashed warning signals on Wednesday. Credit default swaps (CDS) on RBS were trading at 343.54 basis points, meaning the annual cost to insure £10m of the state-backed lender's bonds against default is now £343,540. 

The cost of insuring RBS bonds is now higher than before the taxpayer was forced to step in and rescue the bank in October 2008, and shows the recent dramatic downturn in sentiment among credit investors towards banks. 

"The problem is a shortage of liquidity – that is what is causing the problems with the banks. It feels exactly as it felt in 2008," said one senior London-based bank executive. 

"I think we are heading for a market shock in September or October that will match anything we have ever seen before," said a senior credit banker at a major European bank. 

Despite this, bank shares rebounded on Wednesday, showing the growing disconnect between equity and credit investors. RBS closed up 9pc at 21.87p, while Barclays put on 3pc to 149.6p despite credit default swaps on the bank hitting a 12-month high. This mirrored the US trend, with Bank of America shares up 10pc in late Wall Street trade after a hitting a 12-month low on Tuesday over fears that it might have to raise as much as $200bn (£121bn). As with the European banks, the rebound in the share price was not reflected in the credit markets, where its CDS reached a 12-month high of 384.42 basis points. 

European stock markets joined in the rally. The FTSE closed up 1.5pc at 5,206 on hopes the chance of a global recession had diminished. European shares hit a one-week high, with Germany's DAX closing up 2.7pc and France's CAC 1.8pc higher. The Dow Jones index edged higher on strong durable goods orders data as markets began to accept that the US Federal Reserve is unlikely to signal fresh stimulus at Jackson Hole this Friday. 

Even Moody's decision to downgrade Japan's sovereign credit rating by one notch to Aa3 did little to damage global sentiment, although Tokyo's Nikkei closed down just over 1pc. 

As stock market nerves settled, gold - which has recorded steady gains recently as investors seek a safe haven - fell 5.3pc to $1,777 in London.

Hurricane Irene: Could Be Category 4 By Thursday








By LINSEY DAVIS, JESSICA HOPPER (@jesshop23) and CHRISTINA NG 

Hurricane Irene's fury is growing and the National Hurricane Center warned today that the storm could be upgraded from its current level of Category 3 to a more ominous Category 4 by Thursday. 

The core of the hurricane is expected to move across the southeastern and central Bahamas tonight, with maximum winds near 120 mph. 

As the storm clears the island and continues over the warm water of the Atlantic, its wind speed is expected to strengthen and the size of the storm could increase, the Hurricane Center predicted. 

"Warm water is essentially like their fuel. It helps them strengthen and it's got plenty of that ahead of it, at least in the next few days," said John Cangialosi, a hurricane specialist at the National Hurricane Center. 

The threshold for a category 4 is wind speeds of at least 131 mph. 

Forecasters predict Irene could hit the Outer Banks of North Carolina on Saturday, move up to the mid-Atlantic region including Maryland, Delaware and New Jersey late Saturday or early Sunday, and hit New England late Sunday. 

Hurricane Irene's Fury Is Growing, Possibly Becoming a Category 4 Storm 

The storm is shaping up to be the most powerful hurricane to strike the East Coast of the United States in years and thousands of people in Ocracoke Island, N.C., have been ordered to evacuate as the storm bore down on the frgile islands of North Carolina's Outer Banks. The island is reachable only by ferry. 

Cangialosi also said that hurricanes fluctuate in strength and size, so two days of strengthening could be followed by weakening as the storm moves north. 

"It loses strength considerably when it tracks over cooler water," he said. "For the next couple of days, the general theme is that it will probably continue to strengthen." 

Officials tonight told visitors in North Carolina's Dare County which includes Nags Head and heavily populated northern Outer Banks to evacuate by 8 a.m. Thursday. 

An updated bulletin from the National Hurricane Center said that the "extremely dangerous" storm will raise water levels by as much as seven to eleven feet above normal tide levels in the Bahamas, potentially causing "life-threatening flash floods and mud slides in areas of steep terrain" as well as "life-threatening surf and rip current conditions." 

Hurricane Irene went from a Category 2 to Category 3 from Tuesday night to this morning after ripping street signs out of the ground in the Turks and Caicos and destroying buildings in the Dominican Republic. 

Craig Fugate, the manager of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, urged those from the Mid-Atlantic region to New England to start preparing now for the possibility of the hurricane's landfall. 

"It's going to be close and whether we get a brush or whether we have a landfall, it's too early to say," Fugate said. "Go ahead and make sure you're ready and then if evacuations are required, heed those evacuation orders. The Hurricane Center says this storm is going to grow and strengthen...and it's really something people need to be prepared now for so they can be ready if they have to act." 

Fugate referenced Tuesday's surprise 5.8 magnitude earthquake to urge those living in the Northeast to prepare. 

"It's again a reminder that we don't always get to pick the next disaster," Fugate said. "We know this hurricane is coming this way. We just don't know where it's going to hit or how bad it will get. So take time now to get ready." 

The hurricane's winds stretch over 400 miles. That's the same width as the entire state of Arizona. The Caribbean islands are low and flat which only fuels the strength of the hurricane, meteorologists say. The storm's surge is 7 to 11 feet, meaning that waters are 7 to 11 feet higher in the Caribbean. 

Business owners hurried to board up their stores in the Bahamas and tourists started lining up at airports to get out of harm's way. 

Hurricane Irene Pounds Caribbean

Honeymooners Jennifer and Todd Napier spent Tuesday at the airport booking flights and looking for hotels on their laptop. 

"We tried to book a flight yesterday. They wanted to charge us $2,500 extra so we were like, no, we'll just wait it out and then our hotel made an emergency announcement and told us they're going to kick us out," Todd Napier said. 

Shannon Drury didn't just leave her hotel, she was told the whole Bahamian island of Eleuthera would have to evacuate with officials telling her the danger was "catastrophic." 

Fran Newman plans to ride out the storm in the Bahamas. 

"The hotel has already told us the plans they have for us should there be a major storm and I am comfortable with the plans they have," she said.

China's military catching up to West, Pentagon says








The Defense Department assessment says Beijing appears on track to achieve its goal of building a modern, regionally focused military by 2020.

By David S. Cloud, Los Angeles Times

Reporting from Washington— China's military is closing technical gaps that long have given the United States and its allies a military edge in Asia, although several ambitious new weapons systems and platforms appear years from completion, according to a new Pentagon assessment.

China is developing a new stealth fighter, recently conducted sea trials on its first aircraft carrier and carried out a record number of satellite and other space launches in the last year, the report notes. It says China appears on track to achieve its goal of building a modern, regionally focused military by 2020.

The pace and scope of China's drive has "allowed it to pursue capabilities that we believe are potentially destabilizing" and "may contribute to regional tensions and anxieties," Michael Schiffer, deputy assistant secretary of Defense, said in a Pentagon briefing Wednesday

But China's People's Liberation Army may face difficulties trying to integrate new and complex weapons systems and capabilities into a military that has always relied on manpower, not technology, for national defense, the report adds.

The Obama administration has maintained high-level contacts with China. Vice President Joe Biden completed a visit there this week, and Chinese President Hu Jintao came to Washington in January.

The report comes amid growing concern at the Pentagon over deep cuts in the U.S. defense budget. Defense officials have agreed to cut roughly $400 billion in spending over the next decade, but they worry that the Pentagon will be targeted for deeper cuts to help reduce the federal deficit.

The Pentagon's defenders in Congress have long cited China's military modernization as a potential threat to American interests and a reason not to cut the Pentagon budget.

The Defense Department spends more than $500 billion a year, not including the cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. That dwarfs the estimated $160 billion that China spent on its military last year.

The report warns that China's growing capabilities could allow it to project power in the Western Pacific in an effort to deny access to U.S. and allied naval vessels someday.

But China's first aircraft carrier is a decades-old former Soviet vessel, and the navy won't be able to fly fighter jets from its deck for years, the report says.

Schiffer said he believes Beijing is working toward building its own aircraft carriers, but the report notes that no domestically produced Chinese aircraft carrier could be operational before 2015, assuming construction began this year.

"Whether or not this proves to be a net plus for the region or for the globe, or proves to be something that has destabilizing effects and raises blood pressure in various regional capitals, I think remains to be seen," he added.

The new stealth fighter Beijing is developing, along with longer-range missiles, could give China the ability to strike air bases and other facilities in the region, but the advanced aircraft is still years away from completion, the report says.

Virginia Earthquake a Sign of the End Times? Public Looks to Pat Robertson








By Nicola Menzie / Christian Post Contributor

Is it a coincidence that an earthquake that struck Virginia and rattled dozens of other states occurred amid Pat Robertson's "Sign of the Times" special on the "700 Club?"

"Are we in the last days?" Robertson asked during Wednesday morning's live online streaming of the "700 Club" as he continued his teaching on the "Sign of the Times."

"The earth moved," Robertson said ominously, describing the earthquake that struck Virginia Tuesday, "and then it moved all over this part of the country."

As a magnitude 5.8 earthquake struck Virginia around 1:51 p.m. on Tuesday, many folks wondered about its unusual strength. Aftershocks were felt all along the East Coast, West Coast, in some southern states, and even in Canada.

Don Blakeman, a geophysicist with the National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC), told The Christian Post Wednesday that although Virginia has a fair number of earthquakes like most other states, the temblor's strength was unusual.

"Virginia has a fair number of quakes ... but they are typically small. [Virginia] does have a number of them every year, but it is pretty unusual to have one of this size," Blakeman said.

The NEIC geophysicist added, "We should expect some aftershocks, because when you have a good size quake like this then it’s pretty typical to have some aftershocks. It's possible to have some fairly large ones, but most of them will be [in the 3.0 range]."

Earthquake activity was one of the signs of the end, Robertson said, referring to other occurrences such as food shortages and conflicts between nations, which Christians believe will precede Christ's return.

Robertson explained in Wednesday's program, which focused on natural disasters, that earthquakes are one of the "birth pangs" Jesus Christ refers to in Matthew 24 after his disciples ask about the signs preceding his second coming.

The televangelist, who started his series on signs of the end times on Monday, was not alone in looking to the fulfillment of biblical prophecies amid the quake.

Twitter users took to their accounts yesterday, wondering if the CBN televangelist would speak out on the earthquake.

"Earthquake in DC? Stand by for a Biblical explanation from Pat Robertson," tweeted Armistead Maupin (@ArmisteadMaupin).

Erin Fleming (@ERINonyourRADIO) tweeted, "A hurricane headed for the US, an earthquake this morning in D.C. and rioting in parts of the states as well. Back to you Pat Robertson."

Some Twitter users were skeptical, scoffing at the possibility of God revealing any kind of prophetic word to Robertson.

A handful of comments appeared to make reference to Robertson's controversial remarks during the 2010 earthquake that struck the Caribbean nation of Haiti.

Robertson said, just one day after the rattler devastated the small island, that its people were possibly cursed for allegedly making a deal with the devil during the 1791 slave rebellion against the French.

User warrenstjohn (@warrenstjohn) tweeted, "Eagerly awaiting Pat Robertson's pronouncements on who did what to deserve an earthquake."

Patti (@Floridaline) wrote, "Yippee!!! Tomorrow, Gods Meteorologist, Pat Robertson, will tell us why there was an earthquake near DC!!"

Despite the anticipation, Robertson made it clear Wednesday that he had not received any prophetic word from God regarding the earthquake.

"I can't claim any kind of particular revelation," Robertson said in response to a viewer's question about upcoming natural disasters.

Some viewers of the "700 Club's" "Sign of the Times" program were also skeptical that Tuesday's earthquake was any kind of sign from God about the end of the world.

"We've always had natural disasters, many far worse than the Great Virginia Quake of 2011. So why are the events more of a sign than the events of the past," a viewer watching the live program asked in an accompanying chat room.

Other viewers asked Robertson to comment on the rapture, the possible role of the Roman Catholic Church in end time prophecies, and about the possible identity of the antichrist.

No one appeared to ask when the world can be expected to end, but Robertson had an answer for that anyway.

"It will end when the Gospel is preached to the whole world as a witness," Robertson concluded in Wednesday's program.

The "Sign of the Times" program runs through the rest of the week.
