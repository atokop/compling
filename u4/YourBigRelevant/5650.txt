					 Virginia earthquake delays flights at JFK and airports in Newark and Washington The 5.9 earthquake centered in Mineral, Virginia, about 90 miles south of Washington, D.C. has resulted in flight delays at JFK Aiport in New York City as well as airports in Newark International as well as Reagan National airport near Washington, D.C. in Virginia. As a precaution, air traffic control towers were evacuated at JFK, Reagan, and the Newark airports.   A "ground stop" was initiated.  That temporarily halted flights but air traffic is expected to soon get back to normal.   The FAA is advising air...

Geologist Says Major Earthquake Imminent for California - Jim Berkland

Interviewer is Bil Carroll KFI 640 am Los Angeles Within days of the Sendai event, retired geologist Jim Berkland began sounding warnings that another earthquake could occur, specifically in California or off its coast, on or about March 19. Berkland has a remarkable reputation for earthquake forecasting; in fact, many credit him with predicting the Loma Prieta Earthquake of October 17, 1989, commonly known as the "World Series Earthquake" because many San Francisco residents, who otherwise might have become casualties, were in the Candlestick Park stadium at the time, anticipating Game 3 (later rescheduled). (On that account, only 67 people lost their lives, despite $6 billion in damage.) Berkland had warned that such an event might occur days before. Now he points out at least four risk factors: 1. The moon will be not only full, but at perigee. In fact this will be the closest perigee that the moon will have for the next five years. Experts have recently had to accept the role of tidal forces in the triggering of earthquakes. (See Maya Tolstoy et al., "Breathing of the Seafloor: Tidal Correlations of Seismicity at Axial Volcano," Geology, Vol. 30, June 2002, pp. 503--506.) 2. The next day will be the vernal equinox, which produces the equinoctial tides, another stressor on account of the earth's axial inclination. 3. The California coast has recently seen a massive and unexplained fish kill. Such fish kills, and aberrant behavior of pets and livestock, have been <b>...</b>

A NASA funded earthquake prediction program has an amazing track record. Published in 2002, the Rundle-Tiampo Forecast has accurately predicted the locations of 15 of California's 16 largest earthquakes this decade, including last week's tremors. www.nasa.gov Seismologists say the Hayward fault, which runs directly under the East Bay's western lowlands and last gave way in 1868, is due for a dramatic lurch — an earthquake powerful enough to cripple Read more at the San Francisco Examiner: www.sfexaminer.com

8/24/2011 Why did the Virginia nuke plant, built on fault line, have its quake sensors removed?

I extracted the Thom Hartman interview segment with Beyond Nuclear's Paul Gunter concerning the North Anna Nuclear Generating Station which is run by Dominion Generation (the company stock is listed as Dominion Resources). Some disturbing points are brought up. This nuclear power plant actually had its seismic sensors removed in the 1990's due to budget cuts. The Lake Anna Dam, which was constructed on the North Anna River to create Lake Anna, an artificial reservoir to cool the North Anna nuclear plant, was recently inspected for earthquake damage and passed inspection. However, as Mr. Gunter notes, America's crumbling infrastructure has low D- ratings on many of its dams with regards to upkeep, including this one. Also, due to the nuclear power plant being very close to the epicenter of the 5.8 magnitude quake, Gunter feels that damage to the nuclear plant's is likely, such as cracked pipes which in the case of the Dresden nuclear power plant in Illinois, leaked radioactive tritium. Link to original Thom Hartman interview which includes other segments: youtu.be Good article that speculates that the North Anna Nuclear Generating Station has been damaged and possibly leaking radiation: www.examiner.com

When you submit your personally identifiable information through wn.com, you are giving your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. If you would prefer that we not collect any personally identifiable information from you, please do not provide us with any such information. We will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to third parties without your consent, except as otherwise disclosed in this Privacy Policy.

Except as otherwise disclosed in this Privacy Policy, we will use the information you provide us only for the purpose of responding to your inquiry or in connection with the service for which you provided such information. We may forward your contact information and inquiry to our affiliates and other divisions of our company that we feel can best address your inquiry or provide you with the requested service. We may also use the information you provide in aggregate form for internal business purposes, such as generating statistics and developing marketing plans. We may share or transfer such non-personally identifiable information with or to our affiliates, licensees, agents and partners.
We may retain other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Such third parties may be provided with access to personally identifiable information needed to perform their functions, but may not use such information for any other purpose.
In addition, we may disclose any information, including personally identifiable information, we deem necessary, in our sole discretion, to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal proceeding or governmental request.
2. E-mail addresses
We do not want you to receive unwanted e-mail from us. We try to make it easy to opt-out of any service you have asked to receive. If you sign-up to our e-mail newsletters we do not sell, exchange or give your e-mail address to a third party.
E-mail addresses are collected via the wn.com web site. Users have to physically opt-in to receive the wn.com newsletter and a verification e-mail is sent. wn.com is clearly and conspicuously named at the point of collection.

If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by e-mailing us at michaelw(at)wn.com
The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during registration and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100 percent secure, however. Therefore, though we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

If we decide to change our e-mail practices, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we think appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
If we make material changes to our e-mail practices, we will notify you here, by e-mail, and by means of a notice on our home page.

4. Business Transfers
As we continue to develop our business, we might sell certain aspects of our entities or assets. In such transactions, user information, including personally identifiable information, generally is one of the transferred business assets, and by submitting your personal information on Wn.com you agree that your data may be transferred to such parties in these circumstances.
