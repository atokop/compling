Felt reports from this aftershock :
Charlottesville, VA : 5:09Đ˝Đ° 8 seconds of light shaking – enough to rattle the windows, wake us, and the dogs.
Locust Grove, VA – Lasted approx 20 – 30 sec
Spotsylvania, VA – Felt like the house was going over rumble strips on the highway…lasted about 30 ŃĐľĐşŃĐ˝Đ´Đ¸.
Scottsville, VA – Lasted perhaps 7 or 8 ŃĐľĐşŃĐ˝Đ´Đ¸.
New Canton, VA – I had just awoken and felt the house shake. There was a slight "boom" as if something had hit the house and then I heard the windowframes rattling and heard the rumble.  This is the 4th aftershock I have felt/heard at home since the quake last week.
Montpelier, VA – Awakened by loud rumbling sound.
Oldenburg, IN – I was in bed and it was shaking slightly–for what felt like a very long minute. I looked at my clock and saw it was 5:10 Đ˝Đ° (ER : Hard to believe as we speak of a distance to the epicenter of 400 ĐźĐ¸ĐťŃ!)
Cartersville, VA : We have been getting moderate shaking every night since the bigger Quake.They sound like train coal cars stopping, lots of banging the louder the bang the worst in the shaken of the house. It goes by with the loudest bang with a lifting or wave and then slowly the banging goes away in the distance ,like a train going down the train tracks.
Nelson, VA : Rattled my windows.
Richmond, VA : At approximately 5 am this morning, Sept 1, my husband and I woke up as our ceiling fan and windows were shaking for about 30 seconds.  It was pretty strong to wake us up but not enough for us to run out of the house.
Goochland County, VA : Felt quake around 5 am this morning. Had to straighten pictures on the wall again!
Petersburg, VA : ĐĄĐ˛ŃŃĐťĐž ŃŃŃŃŃŃĐ˛Đ°Đ˝Đ˝Ń
Alexandria, VA : Woke up to its effect of causing large mirror to fall and shatter in bathroom.
Manakin Sabot, VA : It was about 5:10 this morning…I woke up to my bed shaking and the house rattling. A very disturbing thing to wake up to!
Lake Monticello, VA : Awakened suddenly by fairly strong rumbling & shaking a little after 5 Đ˝Đ°. ĐĐľŃĐľŃĐľĐ˝Ń 1, 2011.
Unionville, VA : My clock said 5:04 but its all the same.. loud rumble, lasted about half a minute or so and the shaking of the walls and floors last almost as long.. I heard the rumble a few seconds before i felt the house shake. So, i got up and checked on everyone and i was the only one who was woke up from the loud rumble.
So i went back to bed and said man i hope thats the end of it… That is the third one to wake me from a dead sleep. The one just before 1:00 am and the one the next morning just after 1:00 am last week were the first two to wake me up out of 3 times total. Now i just wish i knew it was the end of it! as i don't like them at night!! LOL.
ĐĐ˝ĐžĐ˛ĐťĐľĐ˝Đ˝Ń 29/08 – 11:48  PM Local time :  Another aftershock going along with some light shaking has struck the Virginia earthquake area.  Epicenter on almost the same location than the mainshock, close to Mineral and Louisa.

Felt report(s) :
Charlotteville, Va : In Charlottesville near Pantops area, August 30th I felt another tremor around 11:20pm last night, August 29th…..lasted about 10 seconds.  Did anyone else feel it? – MMI III
ĐĐ˝ĐžĐ˛ĐťĐľĐ˝Đ˝Ń 27/08 – 11:16  PM Local time :  A weak 2.7 magnitude aftershock struck the area at a depth of 5.1 km at 11:16 PM on August 27.  The epicenter was located closest to Louisa Ń Mineral Ń 42 km from Charlottesville, VA
Felt Reports from this aftershock :
Orange, VA – I felt a very weak aftershake in Gordonsville, Orange County, VA, at around 11:30 or so. Gordonsville is located only a short distance from Mineral which was the epicenter of last week's earthquake, and I have felt several aftershakes since then. Every time there is an aftershake, I can hear the underground explosion, but the sound is extremely low. I think we also had an aftershake earlier this evening, though I am not 100% sure. I am, however, positive that we had an aftershake at 11:30 here in Gordonsville. Even my cat reacted visibly to it. – MMI III
Fluvanna, VA – MMI VI Strong shaking indicated. (ER : Fluvanna is situated approx. 20 ĐşĐź Đ˛ŃĐ´ ĐľĐżŃŃĐľĐ˝ŃŃŃ)

ĐĐ˝ĐžĐ˛ĐťĐľĐ˝Đ˝Ń : So far we have received I Have Felt It reports with a max. ĐżĐžĐźŃŃĐ˝Đ¸Đź ŃŃŃŃŃŃĐ˛Đ°Đ˝Đ˝Ń (MMI V), which corresponds with the theoretical USGS values. A V MMI is described as a moderate shaking with possible light damage at vulnerable buildings. Light damage is like cracks in walls, fallen tiles, Ń Ń.Đ´..
ĐĐ˝ĐžĐ˛ĐťĐľĐ˝Đ˝Ń : Aftershocks likes this one are perfectly normal after a 5.9 earthquake. Occasionally an isolated 5+ quake might be possible too. A greater aftershock than the initial 5.9 is also possible, but the chance on it is very exceptional.
ĐĐ˝ĐžĐ˛ĐťĐľĐ˝Đ˝Ń :  Based on the many Felt reports we are receiving we do expect at max. some additional minimal damage within a radius of 5 ĐşĐź Đ˛ŃĐ´ ĐľĐżŃŃĐľĐ˝ŃŃŃ (which means Cuckoo alone).
ĐĐ˝ĐžĐ˛ĐťĐľĐ˝Đ˝Ń : Epicenter of the earthquake below Cuckoo and approx. 8 km from Mineral

ĐĐ°ŃĐ¸Đ˝ĐłŃĐžĐ˝, DC – Just about to fall off to sleep. Awaken by bed shaking (not in a good way either). This aftershock lasted longer than Tuesday's initial earthquake too. This was a rumble feeling that shook my whole house….and I now need a Valium….or 3. – MMI IV

PA, – Dozing on the couch in my living room in SW PA w/my cat.  Felt "something" just shake the house rapidly.  Woke up & scared the hell out of both of us.  Thought someone had hit the house and/or was trying to break in.  After ascertaining that everything was ok & no one trying to break in, checked the laptop & sure enough VA was hit w/an aftershook. – MMI IV
Mount Sidney, VA – I was watching television. The clock read 1:10 Đ˝Đ°. It was less intense than the original quake, but the vibration frequency was about the same. It was just strong enough to shake a DVD off the top of the DVD player. The ceiling fan shook slightly. Two kids and a wife in bed, they didn't feel a thing. – MMI V
Mineral, Va – Was real short, but felt rather violent.  Not sustained like the main earthquake.  Was like a 2 sec. heavy shake or more like a jump feeling for me, like i bounced up outta my couch, then just the dull roar sound with minimal vibration as if bass speakers were maxed – MMI IV
Melfa, VA – I was at work and felt a strong shake.  Everything on the counter rattled and fell in the floor.  It was hard to keep your balance. Everyone looked at me after it was over and all I could say was "I DIDN'T DO IT!" After work my fiance' and I returned home to find that all pictures on the wall and and lamps were in the floor. – VI
Vienna, VA – At about 1:07Đ˝Đ°, I felt a light shaking that last 5 seconds while lying on couch-I knew it was an earthquake right away.  The dog became very restless and nervous afterwards. IV
Annandale, Va -  I was watching TV in a second floor bedroom, felt an initial slight jolt and immediately knew what it was.  Could feel the chair vibrating and could hear a rattling noise from vibrating furniture and/or other objects in the room.  I Put my hand on side of the dresser and could definitely feel vibrations coming up through the floor.  It lasted at least 20 ŃĐľĐşŃĐ˝Đ´Đ¸; definitely not a normal occurrence! It happened about 1:08 Đ´Đž 1:10 AM, 25 Aug., 2011. – IV

Bethesda, MA – Felt this one too, my watch showed 1:09 AM EST by the time tremors ended. Felt it all, just like the one on Tuesday, as I was sitting in my bed, working on the laptop, just as Tuesday. Considering earthquakes are not very common for this area, was pretty scary. The noise of the windows vibrating here in the house was creepy, both earlier and on Tuesday … One of the 2 cats started miaowing aggresively right after the quake. – Đ
Towson, MD – I felt week shaking about 1:10 am Thursday 8/25/2011.  I was laying in bed. It was for few seconds, was going to wake up everybody in the  house as I realized what it was but then it stopped – III

ĐŃŃĐłŃĐ˝ŃŃ, ?? – I was in bed reading approximately 1:10 am.  My husband was asleep beside me.  When the house started rattling I thought, "Oh boy…again?" It didn't last more three-five seconds but I asked Ken, "Did you feel it?  We just had another quake."  I woke him, the tremor did not.  Glad to know that others felt it also and my imagination wasn't working overtime! – IV
McLean, VA – Light shaking indicated – MMI IV
Maryland, Aspen Hill - Sitting in my living room around 1am, I felt light trembling similar to what we experienced July 2010 when a 3.4 magnitude tremor occurred with epicenter about 20 miles from my house.  Sounded like a large truck speeding by but I live on a narrow side street that would not have that type of traffic that time of night – III
Richmond, ĐŃŃĐłŃĐ˝ŃŃ – I felt the aftershock of the earthquake early this morning; I watched as my iron danced about half an inch from its original position on my ironing board in my room. The picture frames shook too, but there was no damage to anything. It sounded like a caravan of 18-wheeler trucks drove by right outside the window. I thought it was another earthquake, because I could feel it shaking from deep within my chest, which does not occur when a truck or something big goes by. My roommate, who was down the hall, didn't feel anything – III
Lanexa, VA -  At about 1:05am we felt the whole house shake with some items falling off of a she'll in the bedroom. It lasted maybe 10 or so seconds – Đ

Frederick, Maryland – I was sleeping at the time, and i was awaken by feeling that something violently threw my head back i was quite scared and i did not know what it was until this morning – VII
Columbia, MD – Just falling asleep at about 1:00am last night (Aug 25, 2011) when the floors started creaking and we thought someone might be in our house. Then other items started shaking too and we knew it must be an aftershock from the Mineral, VA earthquake 2 days ago. We've read that this aftershock was a 4.8 and located close the original epicenter – Đ
Eldersburg, MD – I was awakened on 5/24 at approx 12:45 a.m. and on 5/25 at approx. 1:07 a.m. by the rattle of the doors on an old stand in my bedroom.  I did not feel any shaking in the bed, just heard the rattle of the doors that woke me up. I have lived in this house 16 years and never experienced such rattle.  III: Weak Shaking
Bethesda, MA – Felt this one too, my watch showed 1:09 AM EST by the time tremors ended. Felt it all, just like the one on Tuesday, as I was sitting in my bed, working on the laptop, just as Tuesday. Considering earthquakes are not very common for this area, was pretty scary. The noise of the windows vibrating here in the house was creepy, both earlier and on Tuesday … One of the 2 cats started miaowing aggresively right after the quake. – Đ
Towson, MD – I felt week shaking about 1:10 am Thursday 8/25/2011.  I was laying in bed. It was for few seconds, was going to wake up everybody in the  house as I realized what it was but then it stopped. – III
Monroe, Va – Woke me up, Strong aftershock felt about 1:08 a.m. in Monroe, Va. for a couple of seconds.
Baltimore, MD – I was finally drifting to sleep after 24 hours of sleeplessness and suddenly jolted awake as the bed shook and several things in my bedroom moved across their shelves. In other parts of our home small items were out of place or knocked over. Not nearly as bad as Tuesday's quake but I certainly won't be sleeping well for a while… – IV
Apple Grove, VA – We are 3 miles from the epicenter.  Before the quake there were 2 light, short tremors.  One around midnight, the next just a few minutes before – Đ
White Oak, Montgomery County, MD – I was awakened at 1:08 am by light-to-moderate shaking, and realized immediately that we were experiencing an aftershock.  I was not in the same location (my bed) when the original quake occurred, so I cannot compare the two events (in fact, I was walking around downtown Rockville, MD, and didn't detect it at all), however, the intensity and duration of this event was slighty less than what I felt last year when I was also awakened from sleep by an earthquake which was centered in Germantown, MD. – IV
Mineral VA – I was a sleep and the house started shaking and rumbling again.  It was about 1:06 Đ˝Đ°, will this soon stop? – MMI VI (Strong Shaking)
Lynchburg, VA – At a little after 1:00 am I was awakened by my shaking bed and pictures and a slight rumble.  I thought "here we go again!"  Scary….. – IV
Lynchburg, VA – Awakened just after 1 AM Thursday a.m. by shaking and by very strange house sounds…nothing I can liken to anything I've heard in the house before (and I wasn't at home for the Tuesday afternoon quake).  Shaking was continuous but house sounds came in several waves over several seconds.  At its peak, I also heard a noise from outside…possibly our deck rattling – Đ

Alexandria, VA – 1:08 AM Thursday, August 25.  The house-shaking-noise was minor this time, but I felt the movement under my feet as I was sitting at my computer.  The dogs did not react this time at all, but it was still unsettling (it lasted quite awhile). – IV
Bumpass, VA – I live just outside the epicenter area and last night i woke up at 1:08 to my house shaking.. it felt like how a cheap hotel would shake as a train goes by. it was strong enough to wake me but not major. basically just vibrated my house. – IV-V

Mineral, VA – I live 3 miles from the center of that aftershock and I thought tt wasn't as long as bad as the 4.2 from the night before.  It is all the little rumbling all night long that makes it interesting. – MMI V
Stafford VA – I heard a long (maybe 30 ŃĐľĐşŃĐ˝Đ´Đ¸) low steady rumbling at 12:45. My time seems to be off from everyone else so I am wondering if I am wrong? It was either an aftershock or Marine Base Quantico doing some sort of bombing at that time of the morning, which I doubt. I got up to look around – nothing shaking, just vibrating with this low rumbling. It lasted too long to be a low flying plane or truck rumbling by, so I guess aftershock – III

Green Bay VA – I was sitting on my couch watching tv around 1am and the house started shaking. Unlike the initial quake this one made the dishes in my cabinets rattle. It lasted maybe 20-30 seconds but didn't wake anyone else in the house up. This one was quieter than the initial one as well. There was an aftershock or something a few hours after the one on the 23rd but even though everyone was awake nobody felt it but me and my dogs. I barely even felt it. – III
Bumpass, VA – 11:27 am felt short aftershock about 4 ŃĐľĐşŃĐ˝Đ´Đ¸….just want it to stop. We are just a few short miles from Mineral, where our kids attend school. Still unsettling! – MMI IV

Crystal City, VA – Slight aftershock at 1:08Đ˝Đ°, 1:14, Ń 1:20am.  House made sounds like with a strong wind blowing. Nothing fell off shelfs as they did during earthquake.  Getting kind of stressed over it. Not moving to West coast! – III

Clifton, ĐŃŃĐłŃĐ˝ŃŃ – Our family was sleeping around 1:00 a:m.  I awoke to the bed shaking and instantly knew it was an aftershock. My husband felt it as well. Our children said they were not awakened by it.  It was not anywhere close to what we experienced on Tuesday but I would describe it as light to moderate shaking.  I'm sure it would have seemed greater if you were awake and standing or sitting rather than lying down when it occurred. – Đ
Mineral VA – Crazy Like the beginning of the 5.9 but stopped much quicker! Thank goodness – Đ
Alexandria, VA – ĐŁŃĐžŃĐ° Đ˛Đ˛ĐľŃĐľŃŃ, just after 1 a.m., I was awoken by shaking. It felt like a train was going by the house.

Gettysburg, PA – I was on a horseback tour of the Gettysburg National Battlefield at 1:10 pm today (ĐĄĐľŃĐżĐľĐ˝Ń 25) when my horse and at least three in front of me all stumbled (on flat ground) at the same time.  I was wondering if it was because of an aftershock of the Mineral, VA quake.  Thanks. – MMI III
Arlington VA – A little after 1 am I was lying in bed upstairs in a two story house in northwest Arlington, reading.  Heard a low hum and then felt light to moderate shaking, doors rattling gently in door frames, bed rocking very slightly–much like a train were going by a few houses away.  Not sure how long it went on, but more than 5 seconds.  Did not wake my husband or son. – IV

Ashland, Va – On 23rd I was in Richmond, Va. at Krogers. I started my car because it was so hot and put my groceries in. I noticed that the car was shaking like it had an engine problem and my only worry was "how I was going to fix it". No thought of an erthquake. But on 8/25 at a few minutes after 1:00AM I was at the computer when my chair began to shake and the fax machine(which was not on) began to do it's thing. It was really scary.
Was it an aftershock or another earthquake? (Definitely an aftershock ER)
Greenville, MI – My little terrier was sleeping between my wife and I, when at approximately 1am, she began to whimper and yip quietly, waking me up.  I tried to calm her, thinking she needed to go out, perhaps.  She kept up this behavior for almost ten minutes, then settled down and went back to sleep.  In the meantime, I began to feel my bed vibrate lightly, then growing stronger to the point where I could feel it actually trembling, then subduing over the course of about two minutes.  I awoke my wife, but she had felt nothing.  The next morning, the news mentioned an aftershock had occurred early that morning.  I can only assume that is what I felt. – MMI III
Fredericksburg, VA – I woke up to the house shaking.  The windows rattled and some CD's fell off the shelf.  This was quicker than the first one. – MMI VI

Arlington VA  – A little after 1 am I was lying in bed upstairs in a two story house in northwest Arlington, reading.  Heard a low hum and then felt light to moderate shaking, doors rattling gently in door frames, bed rocking very slightly–much like a train were going by a few houses away.  Not sure how long it went on, but more than 5 seconds.  Did not wake my husband or son. – MMI IV
Madison Heights, VA – ĐżŃĐž 1:00 am ish heard strange noise, like train rumbling, lasting 15-30 secs, dogs down street started barking prior to rumbling sound, just an eerie feeling, house made noises like settling ceiling made cracking sounds, walls made noises. The train sound is common, since trains hook up in lynchburg everyday, assuming is not always what it is.
Columbia, SC – Sitting on the sofa with someone. They thought I was shaking the sofa. Lasted about a minute. – MMI III
Ashland ĐŃŃĐłŃĐ˝ŃŃ – Sitting on the couch after dinner I heard rumbling and shaking. My attention turned to the window and it crossed my mind what if then I remembered that a train amtrack runs through thye center of Ashland.Virginia. It crossed my mind that it was an aftershock but I thought probably the train and would I ever get over the fear of a Earthquake every time I heard a train always listning for the whistle is now a constant reassuring sound I lookout for . Resigned to the fact that it was a train I put it out of my mind and went about watching a show on TV. So it really wasnt a surprise that I found out from my friend we had a aftershock and I guessed it was about a 4 pretty lucky guess it was a 4.5 I am getting pretty good at guessing the Richter scale,Earthquakes and a Hurricane all in one week do I dare ask what next? well it all could of been much worse but prayers going out to all the peopke adversly affected. We just have to be prepared these days for any thing and make sure we don't take anything or those close to us for granted. – MMI V
Reston, VA – 4 AM in Reston, VA. A/C is off, & I am the only one up. Definitely felt house shaking–still feeling it. Long time this time. Subtle, but present – MMI IV

I know you find it hard to believe I felt it in Indiana, but that’s what was so….gentle rocking and noticing the time 5:10 and then reading that an aftershock happened at 5:09. When the 1st one happened on 8/23, people felt it near my area and even further west though I can’t say I felt anything then.

I am located in Grandy, NC and felt a light tremor lasting not more than 2-3 seconds at 3:40 a.m. What is the likelyhood that this was an aftershock? Have there been any other reports or signs of activity? I realize not many people would be awake at this time to make such a report, but the first time it happened I felt a strong shaking for about 8-10 ŃĐľĐşŃĐ˝Đ´Đ¸. I questioned whether it was just me and said nothing. Now I can’t help but wonder.
