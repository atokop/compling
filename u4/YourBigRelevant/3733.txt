East coast earthquake reveals faults in nuclear emergency planning
In Virginia, the quake shut down the North Anna reactor – a warning that our 'worst-case scenario' may not be bad enough

To say that Tuesday's east coast earthquake surprised everyone would be an understatement. In a post 9/11 world, those of us in Washington always have the vague fear of something bad happening lurking in our subconscious. That fear is usually of an event caused by humans, not of a natural disaster, but we never really can know what Mother Nature has in store for us.This is why our best bet is planning for the worst. And when we look at the US nuclear energy infrastructure, it becomes clear that we aren't planning for the worst – not even close.We had a pretty good warning earlier this year, when the tragic earthquake and tsunami in Japan caused an even bigger tragedy when the Fukushima nuclear power plant suffered a meltdown. Tuesday's earthquake was the worst on the east coast of the US since 1944, measuring at 5.8 on the Richter scale. And while we certainly avoided the kind of crisis that Japan has endured, two nuclear reactors near the site, at the North Anna nuclear power plant, were shut down following the quake. The plant temporarily lost power and halted operations until it switched to back-up generators. Twelve other plants around the country were put on alert following the quake.Though a spokesman for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission told reporters that "as far as we know, everything is safe", the event revived fears about the safety of US nuclear plants. Most of the region's reactors were reportedly designed to withstand a 5.9 to 6.1 magnitude quake – which means Tuesday's quake was, for many, too close for comfort.At Fukushima, the reactors were built to withstand a 7.9 magnitude quake. But then, they were hit with a 9.0 quake. While it's true that the bigger problem at Fukushima was the loss of power and the failure of back-up power to keep the cooling systems running, it was a reminder that we never know exactly what kind of curveballs nature will throw at us. Nuclear plants are supposed to be able to handle the anticipated quake intensity and likelihood relevant to their location. But what happens when the quake is stronger than anyone anticipated? And what happens if something else goes wrong, too?The North Anna plant is located about 15 miles from the epicentre of the quake in Mineral, Virginia. It was designed to withstand a 6.2-magnitude quake, according to its owner, Dominion Resources. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission lists the plant as one of the 10 US plants most at risk of damage in a seismic event. So, it seems like we got lucky in this case.We're also lucky that this particular plant isn't as close to an urban centre as many others in the US. It's nearly 50 miles from Richmond, and about 100 miles from Washington, DC. But the plant that the NRC deemed most at risk was the Indian Point 3 reactor in Buchanan, New York – just 38 miles from New York City. This is the primary reason why New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has called for the plant to be shut down. After Fukushima, everyone within 50 miles of the plant had to be evacuated. Right now, our evacuation plans for all our nuclear sites only cover a 10-mile radius. If something really bad were to happen at Indian Point, it could create the need to evacuate 21 million people.We need to seriously consider the potential for a combination of events like those in Japan earlier this year – a natural disaster (or two), infrastructure failure and the human migration that would inevitably occur in its wake. But the NRC has so far defended its minimal emergency zones, despite unease about preparedness.I don't believe we're going to shut down our existing nuclear energy infrastructure entirely any time soon. But at the very least, the 23 August quake should be a reminder that our worst-case scenarios might not be bad enough. We should perhaps rethink just how ready we are for the worst.

What happened at Fukushima was unpredicted, unique and devastating. What will happen somewhere else in the World tomorrow, next year, or in a hundred years time will be equally 'unpredicted, unique and devastating.' Dont take the risk, nuclear energy will ruin your health.

"We are human and we never err, ergo, they are safe."Yes we are human, yes we do err, but to complain that things can never be completely safe condemns us to doing nothing.Very little is absolutely safe from power plants to crossing the road. Nuclear power has a pretty damn good record, certainly in the US, compared to any other method of generating power, or did you forrget that little incident in the Gulf?

I think the best way to ensure nuke power plants are up to scratch is to make everyone responsible for how they are built & operated live in the shadow of the cooling towers. Not the boys & girls on the floor, the execs & their families. Their kids should also attend schools built in the grounds. Nothing to fear, right ?Sleep well in the (should it be glowing like that ?) fire.

It was noted that during the Fukushima incident, there were very many outspoken contributors to these CIF pages who condemmed anyone who dared to query the safety of the nuclear energy industry. In some cases this criticism was fanatical. This occurence was commented upon at the time and questioned as to whether the nuclear industry actually organised some of the comments to be posted on it's behalf. I am not sure, one way or the other that a conspiracy actually exists, but I am upset by the this aggressive nature of the pro-nuclear lobby and it is interesting to note that five of the first six comments tonight should be pro-nuclear.

The Richter scale is a logarithmic (to base 10) scale.If the recent earthquake was 5.8 on the Richter scale and the nuclear power stations have a design tolerance of 6.1, then this means that they can stand an earthquake of 10 to the power 0.3 = 2 times as big as the one last week.This seems a moderately good margin for error to me. Especially as the east coast of the USA is not, unlike Japan, sitting on a major subduction zone.

Good to see this getting a mention.Everything we humans do can go wrong. Including nuclear power, riding along on it's knife-edge course at the edge of the catastrophe curve.Best not wait until New York has to be evacuated before waking up and spending our time end energy rolling out renewables.And it's not the cost: Nuclear costs us a fortune - but since that fortune is siphoned out of our paycheques discretely. Sia environmental cleanup costs, state subsidised research and development and a huge big question-mark over "where shall we put the rubbish ?"Not to mention large chunks of valuable real estate laid waste in every nuclear nation on the planet.When will we wake up ?

Refresh - (my comment 7.19 PM) 11 of the first 17 comments tonight are pro-nuclear - amazing ratio after what happened in Japan. Remember all the many Governments around the World that insisted upon re-evaluations of safety systems only a few months ago. Don't be so glib you pro-nuclear supporters. Nuclear plants can be dangerous whatever precautions are seen to be taken. I believe that is all Kate Sheppard is trying to point out to everyone in her article above - argue against that if you will - but firstly read her views again.

when the tragic earthquake and tsunami in Japan caused an even bigger tragedy when the Fukushima nuclear power plant suffered a meltdown. Around 20,000 people died in the tsunami. Nobody died at Fukushima. I think the tsunami is a bigger tragedy. At Fukushima, the reactors were built to withstand a 7.9 magnitude quake. But then, they were hit with a 9.0 quake.No, they weren't. It was 9 at the epicentre. Can't find exact numbers for fukushima, but pretty sure it's less than 7.9. The author seems not to know the magnitude of the quake depends on how far you are from it.

johnandanne,Everthing can be dangerous but it is  only nulclear power that gets this panic nonsense again and again. A train could have been derailed, a building collapse but no we are talking about, well what exactly, what is this failure we came so close to? Even the meltdown at Three Mile Island, the worst nuclear accident in the USA, released precious little radioactivity into the environment, what is it exactly we should all be so scared of?Japan and this have precious little in common, other than to generate column inches in the Guardian.

And while we certainly avoided the kind of crisis that Japan has endured, two nuclear reactors near the site, at the North Anna nuclear power plant, were shut down following the quake.Yes,: that's supposed to happen. You may be right that nuclear power is not a good thing, but please try to learn something about it before writing about it.

Many, or most, scientists and engineers believe global warming is a much bigger threat than nuclear power (I'm in their number). All the nuclear scientists I know think that the risks to health from most low level radiation is exaggerated.

It's sad that those who are so against nuclear power tend to be the sort of people that think we can generate the power we need from current methods of renewable energy.Electrical power is a very recent invention in comparison to the history of the human race. It is not inconceivable that soon we may discover a totally new, totally different form of energy that we can bend to our will (if we don't all kill each other first).In my opinion, more effort needs to be put into finding a totally new way of generating power. The energy that exists in the very fabric of matter has been demonstrated by our discovery and partially-successful taming of nuclear energy. However, we need to take things further.As far as I'm aware, and taking into consideration our current knowledge of physics, the future of energy production either lies in fusion reaction, matter/anti-matter reaction, or the Sun. Let's hope we can all move on together, and secure our future here.

greensox 7:46PM - You appear to be saying in your last paragraph that what happened in Japan was a problem. That is exactly the point being made by  those concerned with the possibility of what happens when a nuclear plant malfunctions. Even if the most serious result of Fukushima is that people can not live near to the old plant for an untold number of years - that in itself is a problem. And we wont know for a generation at least, what effect it might have had on health.

It has nothing to do with nuclear reactors in the Eastern USA.Meanwhile 20,000 died from just living on the coast, should we evacuate New York and Boston?

"At Fukushima, the reactors were built to withstand a 7.9 magnitude quake. But then, they were hit with a 9.0 quake."Yet all the reactors on the east coast of Japan (including Fukushima no.1) survived the quake, well beyond seismic design parameters. It was the tsumami that damaged the auxiliary back-up generators (not anything within the containment or reactor buildings). Rather than knee-jerk reactions and demands for better emergency planning, a simple application of higher sea defences or better waterproofing of back-up generators at nuclear plants would prevent repeats of fukushima type incidences.In conclusion, if there's one lesson than we can learn from the quakes in Japan and USA, it is that nuclear reactors themselves are adequately protected against even the worst case seismic activity. It is better protection of back-up coolant systems that is needed, particularly protection from water damage. Indeed, in newer reactor designs (including those near the fukushima plant, which didn't meltdown) these problems had already been considered and the necessary precautions already taken.

All the nuclear scientists I know think that the risks to health from most low level radiation is exaggerated."Its fairly normal for professionals like you who are in the employ of a particular industry to be supportive of that industry. Just look at bankers who work at a similar level to yourself, they too are very supportive of how banking works and then think about the devasting effect that banking has had on the World economy in recent years.Admit it, the nuclear industry is extremely profit-minded - its not like the teaching or social work professions is it?Your comment gives some insight into my post made at 7 : 19 PM. Whether you know it or not, you are indirectly being paid to support the nuclear industry - if you didn't you would lose your job

@johnandanneAs johnstuartmill put it, these pages attract a lot of scientific types because the coverage is generally better than any other mainstream rag. I'm an energy policy specialist and I'd only take money from the renewables industry, but I'm sick to death of the anti-nuclear hyperbole coming out of the NGOs when any sane person realises that, at best, we have a chance of either killing off coal or nuclear - not both. Based on what I know I'd back nuclear any time, and I just wish those same NGOs (with the honourable exception of Greenpeace) would be at least as vocal about opposing coal as they are about opposing nuclear. Unfortunately it doesn't take a genius to work out why they won't.

"It's good to know you are talking b******s."Ooooh good one,  what a comeback. For a man demanding 'evidence' it is good to know you don't have to stoop to following your own standards of debate. Ad homs are just so cutting.

Nothing to see here folks.... the reactions shut down as a precaution because the external electricity grid tripped off. That's what they're supposed to do, and when they do the backup generators kick in to provide power to the reactor cooling systems.What went wrong in Japan wasn't so much the earthquake but the tsunami. It was higher than any worst-case scenario, it swamped the power station's sea defenses and knocked out the backup generators (not just one, but the backups for the backup). Without the emergency cooling system power the reactors overheated and their cores started melting. This scenario just won't happen on the East Coast -- the seabed's the wrong shape, for a start.The only thing special about this quake was shallow and it was in a part of the world that doesn't usually get quakes. If we'd had a 5.8 in California then unless it occured under the LA Basin or other densely populated area it would maybe merit a 15 second segment on the nightly news.PS -- I'm not a fan of nuclear power.

Stumpysheep 8:23PMYou can get rid of both coal and nuclear power. It will mean a complete re-shaping of how our World exists - but a result of that could be for a much healthier World.
