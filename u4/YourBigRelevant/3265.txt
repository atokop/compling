Bloomberg says’You will go to jail’. Bloomberg no longer allowed to name mules
by phillhillusa



Bloomberg warned residents of New York City that were ordered out of their homes for the upcoming hurricane. “Technically, ignoring the evacuation order would be a violation of the law, a class-B misdemeanor punishable by up to $500 in fines and 90 days in jail,” the mayor said. 
“But if you don’t follow this, people might die . . . We’re not trying to punish people; we’re trying to protect them.” 
New York places sandbags near buildings, over drainage grates.These sandbags are all but functional,but are recommended by Mayor Bloomberg.In the future Mayor Bloomberg will not be allowed to name a mule.
Most people, the mayor said, figure to comply with the order, which is being reinforced by City Council members going door to door and by cop cars with loudspeakers saying, “Hey! C’mon! Your life is in danger!”

Aspirin pills found with anti psychotics in them
by phillhillusa



A Scotland Yard investigation was under way to determine who was behind the plot to put tablets of the prescription medicine Seroquel XL in the packets of the headache pills.
Strips of Seroquel, used for treating schizophrenia, had been deliberately cut to fit inside the packets of the painkiller tablet.
The recall means at least 250,000 packets of Nurofen Plus will have to be sent back.
A safety alert was sparked on Thursday when Seroquel tablets were found inside three packs of Nurofen Plus in Boots stores around London at Victoria, Beckenham and Bromley. Two capsules at the end of the strip had been removed.
Fears of sabotage appeared to be confirmed yesterday when two further packets of the headache pills were found to have been tampered with – one of them containing Seroquel and the other Neurontin, an anti-epileptic drug.
In a statement, the manufacturers Reckitt Benckiser said: “The safety of our consumers is paramount. Even though there have been no serious health consequences to any consumer, we will not take any risk regarding the quality or safety of our products.
“Sabotage is suspected and we are working with the police on a formal investigation to find the person or persons responsible. Distribution of Nurofen Plus has been halted at this time.”
The issue is believed to have arisen at an unknown wholesaler and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has launched an inquiry.
The large Seroquel XL 50mg capsules have gold and black packaging, while the Nurofen Plus tablets are smaller and have silver and black packaging.
The MHRA has issued an alert to all pharmacists. 
The statement by Virgo Health said: “Nurofen Plus is being recalled. Consumers are being asked to return packs of Nurofen Plus to their nearest pharmacy following five reported cases of other manufacturer’s medicines being found in boxes of Nurofen Plus.
“Sabotage is suspected and we are working with the police on a formal investigation to find the person or persons responsible. Distribution of Nurofen Plus has been halted at this time. This decision has been taken in full consultation with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency as a precautionary measure.
“Consumers are advised to return any packs of Nurofen Plus to any pharmacy where a refund will be provided. Pharmacists are advised to return stock to their wholesaler from where it will be collected.”
Dr Aomesh Bhatt, medical director for Nurofen Plus said: “We are taking this matter extremely seriously and have decided to recall all packs of Nurofen Plus as the most prudent course of action in the current circumstances.”

Gaddafi fled to Zimbabwe, seen with Mugabe
by phillhillusa



Colonel Muammar Gaddafi has fled Libya to Zimbabwe on a jet provided by Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe, it was claimed today, as rebels began the march on his home town.
President Mugabe’s political opponents claim their spies saw Gaddafi arrive in the country on a Zimbabwe Air Force jet in the early hours of Wednesday morning.
They say the Libyan dictator was taken to a mansion in Harare’s Gunninghill suburb, where agents from his all-female bodyguard were apparently seen patrolling the grounds.
‘There’s no doubt that Gaddafi is here as a ‘unique guest’ of Mugabe,’ a spokesman for Zimbabwe’s opposition Movement for Democratic Change told the Sun.
If he has left Libya, Gaddafi could have fled from an airbase in his home town of Sirte, which has been bombarded by Nato warplanes in recent days. 
The colonel’s bunker in the coastal town was blitzed by cruise missiles fired by British Tornado jets on a long-range sortie last night.The claims come as:Journalists find evidence of mass graves in Tripoli filled with the bodies of as many as 150 killed in a massacre 
Rebel commanders claimed victory in a vital border town and announced they are to merge their fighters in Tripoli under one command; 
Leaders of the National Transitional Council (NTC) pressed foreign governments to release Libyan funds frozen overseas; 
The British Government pledged to fund humanitarian invervention by the Red Cross; 
United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon asked for international organisations’ help in ensuring an urgent end to fighting and restoration of order in Libya.
As Tripoli came under full rebel control today, journalists from Sky News reported that they had seen evidence of a mass grave after as many as 150 were massacred. 
Stuart Ramsay, the news network’s chief correspondent, said he had counted 53 bodies in a burnt out warehouse shown to him by locals, who said the people there were murdered earlier this week.
Among the dead were two Libyan army soldiers, their hands tied behind their backs, he said, adding: ‘Locals believed they refused to fire and were then murdered.’
Earlier Libyan rebels claimed victory in Ras Jdir, raising their flag at the border post with Tunisia after bloody clashes with regime loyalists. 
There was no sign of a swift end to the civil war, which rebels have vowed will only end when Gaddafi is captured – dead or alive – but they claimed to be closing in on the strongman.
A detachment of rebel fighters was turning its attention to Sirte, Gaddafi’s birthplace, 300 miles east of Tripoli, where British warplanes have bombarded a bunker with cruise missiles.
Some believe that Gaddafi, if he remains in the country, may seek refuge among his tribesmen in the Mediterranean city, which is still holding out against the rebel advance.
Loyalist forces also still hold positions deep in the Sahara desert, days after rebels took much of the capital, looted Gaddafi’s compound and paraded their stolen souvenirs.
‘Sirte remains an operating base from which pro-Gaddafi troops project hostile forces against Misrata and Tripoli,’ said a Nato official, adding that its forces had also acted to stop a column of 29 vehicles heading west toward Misrata.
Meanwhile, leaders of the NTC, the rebel administration, pressed foreign governments to release Libyan funds frozen abroad.
It says the money is urgently needed to impose order and provide services to a population traumatised by six months of civil conflict and 42 years of dictatorial rule.
But Gaddafi’s African allies have continued to offer a grain of comfort to the under-pressure dictator by refusing to recognise the legal government.
The African Union called for the formation of an inclusive transitional government in Libya, saying it could not recognise the rebels as sole legitimate representatives of the nation while fighting continues.
If fighting continues unchecked, there are fears that Libya’s conflict will spill over into the remote regions of Mali, Niger, Chad and Mauritania.
Algeria has said it believes the chaos inside Libya, and large quantities of weapons circulating there, are already being exploited by al Qaeda’s North African branch.And an influential former Malian rebel, believed to have been involved in the trade of looted weapons from Libya, has been killed in Mali, officials said yesterday.
However, taking control of the Ras Jdir border post reopens a path for humanitarian aid and other supplies from Tunisia to Tripoli, where stocks of medicines and fuel are running low. 
The Red Cross today announced that medical support funded by the British Government will help thousands of patients injured during the conflict in Libya, as well as those with serious diseases.
Surgical teams and medicines will be laid on to help up to 5,000 wounded, as well as food and household essentials for almost 690,000.
Red Cross spokesman Steven Anderson said: ‘Medical supplies are one of the main problems that will help people on the ground out there.
‘Many drugs are lacking and the import has been slowed down. Even drugs for cancer, diabetes, kidney failure are running out and that is a real issue.’
The support comes amid reports of harrowing conditions in one Tripoli hospital – the abandoned Abu Salim hospital – where dozens of decomposing bodies were piled up.
It will also include helping families reunite after being broken up by the conflict.

Hundreds of state National Guard troops deployed for Hurricane Irene
by phillhillusa



Hundreds of state National Guard troops deployed for Hurricane Irene began heading to Long Island and the New York City area.
About 900 National Guard soldiers and airmen are being sent Saturday from across New York to the downstate areas expected to bear the brunt of the hurricane.
More than 100 National Guard troops from the Albany area headed to Camp Smith north of New York City and to the Farmingdale Armed Forces Reserve Center on Long Island. Guard members will be able to help out with evacuations, cleanup and other duties.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo is signing an agreement with the federal Department of Defense that sets up a joint command for state National Guard and federal troops deployed in New York for the storm.

TSA agent arrested for child sex assault
by phillhillusa



A city officer arrested a Spring Creek man Wednesday morning at the Elko Area Regional Airport, where he works for the Transportation Security Administration, on a warrant charging six counts of lewdness with a child.
The Elko County Sheriff’s Office was notified in July of possible sexual contact between David Ralph Anderson, 61, and a girl younger than 14.
According to Elko Justice Court records, the victim told investigators that on seven to 10 occasions between 2010 and this year, Anderson allegedly taught the victim about various sexual acts and had sexual contact in the form of touching each other’s genitals.
Investigators reported Anderson also told the girl to sleep in his bed and taught her to say various vulgar words associated with body parts and sexual activities.
Janet Napolitano and alledged lover looked sexually excited after the news was reported to them.
In addition, the girl stated he would rub lotion all over her body, placed his hand up her shirt to touch her breasts, had her watch pornographic films with him, encouraged her to consume alcohol and would French kiss her.
Deputy District Attorney Tyler Ingram submitted a warrant request to Elko Justice of the Peace Al Kacin on Aug. 23, which was granted along with an objection to any reduction of bail.
Anderson, who is a TSA employee according to Elko County Jail records, is being held on $250,000 bail.

$1000 fine for a mosquito on your place
by phillhillusa



The city of Warren is cracking down on those who harbor mosquitoes after the suspected death this week of a Macomb County man from the West Nile Virus.
Mayor Jim Fouts said those who have stagnant pools or ponds and other areas that harbor mosquitoes could face a $1,000 fine.
The mayor said Michigan was one of the top two states in both fatalities and serious illnesses caused by West Nile almost 10 years ago. Under the new plan, Fouts said said inspectors will look for pools of water in places like dumpsters, wheelbarrows, tires, pipes, drains and flower pots.
Homeowners will be given a warning and a chance to fix the problem.
“Every effort will be put forth to protect Warren residents against the dangers posed by mosquito infestation. This year is of particular concern because of the very heavy rain that this area has encountered in the last several months,” said Fouts, in a statement released Friday.
“It’s likely that if we cannot control mosquito breeding in early summer we will have to undergo heavy mosquito biting in late summer and early fall,” he said.
1) Property Maintenance inspectors will be trained by the engineering department for the proper use of the briquettes.
2) Property Maintenance inspectors will be directed to identify pools or ponds of water which would be ideal breeding grounds for mosquito’s. They will also identify other potential breeding areas for mosquitos such as dumpsters, wheelbarrows, tires, hubcaps, garden equipment, pool covers, pipes, drains, recycling bins, flower pots, buckets and clogged rain gutters.
3) Citizens will be encouraged to check the above items and make sure they are emptied of standing stagnant water.
4) If inspectors identify stagnant pools and other major sources of mosquito breeding homeowners will be notified that they must eliminate the problem or
if not they may face fines up to $1000.
5) The Warren DPW will distribute the briquettes to the 18,000 catch basins.
6) The Recreation Department will direct and train their employees to identify and then treat places of standing water in the parks with “mosquito dunks” which are similarly shaped like hockey pucks. They dissolve in water and kill the larvae.
7) The Communication Dept will offer prevention and treatment tips to residents via their Newsbeat seasonal flyer which will be mailed out in July.
  The city will also mail out mosquito information in its monthly water bill.
9) City will contact county officials to get their help in treating catch basins on county roads Van Dyke, Mound, and Schoenherr.
Fouts is encouraging officials in other Metro Detroit cities to adopt a smiliar plan.

Hurricane Irene tears up coast,still destuctive

NAGS HEAD, N.C. (AP) — Weaker but still menacing, Hurricane Irene knocked out power and piers in North Carolina, clobbered Virginia with wind and churned up the coast Saturday to confront cities more accustomed to snowstorms than tropical storms. New York City emptied its streets and subways and waited with an eerie quiet.
With most of its transportation machinery shut down, the Eastern Seaboard spent the day nervously watching the storm’s march across a swath of the nation inhabited by 65 million people. The hurricane had an enormous wingspan – 500 miles, its outer reaches stretching from the Carolinas to Cape Cod – and packed wind gusts of 115 mph.
Almost a million homes and businesses were without power. While it was too early to assess the full threat, Irene was blamed for five deaths.
The hurricane stirred up 7-foot waves, and forecasters warned of storm-surge danger on the coasts of Virginia and Delaware, along the Jersey Shore and in New York Harbor and Long Island Sound. In the Northeast, drenched by rain this summer, the ground is already saturated, raising the risk of flooding.
Irene made its official landfall just after first light near Cape Lookout, N.C., at the southern end of the Outer Banks, the ribbon of land that bows out into the Atlantic Ocean. Shorefront hotels and houses were lashed with waves. Two piers were destroyed, and at least one hospital was forced to run on generator power.
“Things are banging against the house,” Leon Reasor said as he rode out the storm in the town of Buxton. “I hope it doesn’t get worse, but I know it will. I just hate hurricanes.”

By evening, the storm had weakened to sustained winds of 80 mph, down from 100 mph on Friday. That made it a Category 1, the least threatening on a 1-to-5 scale, and barely stronger than a tropical storm. Its center was positioned almost exactly where North Carolina meets Virginia at the Atlantic, and it was picking up speed, moving at 16 mph – up from 13 mph – as it re-emerged over the Atlantic. A hurricane warning had been lifted south of Surf City, N.C.
After the Outer Banks, the storm strafed Virginia with rain and strong wind. It covered the Hampton Roads region, which is thick with inlets and rivers and floods easily, and chugged north toward Chesapeake Bay. Shaped like a massive inverted comma, the storm had a thick northern flank that covered all of Delaware, almost all of Maryland and the eastern half of Virginia.
The deaths included two children, an 11-year-old boy in Virginia killed when a tree crashed through his roof and a North Carolina child who died in a crash at an intersection where traffic lights were out.
In addition, a North Carolina man was killed by a flying tree limb, a passenger died when a tree fell on in a car in Virginia, and a surfer in Florida was killed in heavy waves.
It was the first hurricane to make landfall in the continental United States since 2008, and came almost six years to the day after Katrina ravaged New Orleans. Experts guessed that no other hurricane in American history had threatened as many people.
At least 2.3 million were under orders to move to somewhere safer, although it was unclear how many obeyed or, in some cases, how they could.
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta told 6,500 troops from all branches of the military to get ready to pitch in on relief work, and President Barack Obama visited the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s command center in Washington and offered moral support.
“It’s going to be a long 72 hours,” he said, “and obviously a lot of families are going to be affected.”
In New York, authorities began the herculean job of bringing the city to a halt. The subway began shutting down at noon, the first time the system was closed because of a natural disaster. It was expected to take as long as eight hours for all the trains to complete their runs and be taken out of service.
New York places sandbags near buildings, over drainage grates.These sandbags are all but functional,but are recommended by Mayor Bloomberg.In the future Mayor Bloomberg will not be allowed to name a mule.
On Wall Street, sandbags were placed around subway grates near the East River because of fear of flooding. Tarps were placed over other grates. Construction stopped throughout the city, and workers at the site of the World Trade Center dismantled a crane and secured equipment.
While there were plenty of cabs on the street, the city was far quieter than on an average Saturday. In some of the busiest parts of Manhattan, it was possible to cross a major avenue without looking, and the waters of New York Harbor, which might normally be churning from boat traffic, were quiet before the storm.
The biggest utility, Consolidated Edison, considered cutting off power to 6,500 customers in lower Manhattan because it would make the eventual repairs easier. Mayor Michael Bloomberg also warned New Yorkers that elevators in public housing would be shut down, and elevators in some high-rises would quit working so people don’t get trapped if the power goes out.
“The time to leave is right now,” Bloomberg said at an outdoor news conference at Coney Island, his shirt soaked from rain.
A day earlier, the city ordered evacuations for low-lying areas, including Battery Park City at the southern edge of Manhattan, Coney Island with its famous amusement park and the beachfront Rockaways in Queens.
The five main New York-area airports – La Guardia, John F. Kennedy and Newark, plus two smaller ones – waved in their last arriving flights around noon. The Giants and Jets postponed their preseason NFL game, the Mets postponed two baseball games, and Broadway theaters were dark.
New York has seen only a handful of hurricanes in the past 200 years. The Northeast is much more used to snowstorms – including the blizzard last December, when Bloomberg was criticized for a slow response.
For all the concern, there were early signs that the storm might not be as bad as feared. Some forecasts had it making landfall as a Category 3 storm and perhaps reaching New York as a Category 2.

“Isabel got 10 inches from coming in the house, and this one ain’t no Isabel,” said Chuck Owen of Poquoson, Va., who has never abandoned his house to heed an evacuation order. He was referring to Hurricane Isabel, which chugged through in 2003.
Still, Owen put his pickup truck on a small pyramid of cinder blocks to protect it from the storm tide, which had already begun surging through the saltwater marshes that stand between Poquoson and Chesapeake Bay.
Airlines said 9,000 flights were canceled, including 3,000 on Saturday. Airlines declined to say how many passengers would be affected, but it could easily be millions because so many flights make connections on the East Coast. There were more than 10,000 cancellations during the blizzard last winter.
American Airlines spokeswoman Andrea Huguely said it was not clear when flights would resume out of New York.
“The one thing about a hurricane is that you can prepare for it and you just have to adapt your plan based on how the storm travels,” she said. “It’s basically an educated guessing game.”
Greyhound suspended bus service between Richmond, Va., and Boston. Amtrak canceled trains in the Northeast for Sunday.
The power losses covered 900,000 homes and businesses and were heavily concentrated in Virginia and North Carolina. Dominion Resources reported almost 600,000 customers without power and Progress Energy 260,000, with much of the outages in Wilmington and Wrightsville Beach, N.C.
Irene roared across the Caribbean earlier this week, offering a devastating preview for the United States: power outages, dangerous floods and high winds that caused millions of dollars in damage.

7 dead so far in wake of Hurricane Irene
by phillhillusa



A child died at a Goldsboro, N.C. intersection in a car crash after the storm knocked out power to the traffic light, the Associated Press reports. Several other people were taken to the hospital after the crash.
A surfer hit his head after falling from his board in the storm-tossed waves near New Smyrna Beach, Fla. The beach patrol spokewsoman Tamra Marris said Frederick Fernandez, 55, may have hit the ocean floor and he was pronounced dead shortly after being pulled from the water. The Daytona Beach News Journal reported he was a popular math teacher at the New Smyrna Beach high school.
It brings the death toll to 7 people on Saturday. Another child died in bed after a tree fell onto an apartment building in Newport News, Va. Three men died in North Carolina — one by a falling tree limb, one of a heart attack when he was installing protective plywood to his home, and one when he lost control of his vehicle. A person died in Virginia when a tree feel onto a car.

Perry blasts Obama over jobs
by phillhillusa



Texas Gov. Rick Perry blasted President Obama’s handling of the economy and says his own record of creating jobs qualifies him for the White House.
Perry told nearly 400 activists that he’s created 1 million jobs while governor of Texas, all during a stretch where the nation was losing 2.5 million jobs. Perry says he’ll take a record of cutting taxes and regulation to Washington and says the Texas rebound proves that it works.
Perry was joined at a county GOP picnic by fellow candidates Ron Paul and Thaddeus McCotter, but Perry was getting the bulk of the attention.
Perry pointed to claims that record levels of food stamps are helping the economy grow, and says that’s a sign of failure.

Irene Picks Up Speed As Eye Moves Back Over Atlantic
by phillhillusa


Jarod Wilton looks at the flood waters rising to his doorstep, Saturday, Aug. 27, 2011, in Alliance, N.C., as Hurricane Irene hits the North Carolina coast.

Black Pastor says Obama is evil
by phillhillusa



Harlemites have had enough of a local pastor posting signs at his prominently located church spewing hateful messages about President Obama.
Pastor James David Manning has put up “Obama Is Evil” and “He Used Black Vote to Uncle Tom For Wall St.” on the towering sign outside the ATLAH World Missionary Church on the bustling corner of Lenox Ave. and W. 123rd St.
A church next to Manning’s was so put off by the signs, officials posted their own – to make sure nobody thought their church had anything to do with ATLAH.
“This church is not affiliated with the church on the corner. We Support President Barack Obama,” reads a sign above the front door of Greater Bethel A.M.E. Church.
The controversial sign at ATLAH, which Manning changes from time to time, has targeted Obama since he took office – and has become an attraction for pedestrians, as well as tourists passing by on double-decker buses.
“It’s not something that represents this community,” said Belynda M’baye, 53, who lives near the church and walks past the sign every day. “It sends out a message that all of Harlem is not supporting \[Obama\] and that’s not true. I don’t think that’s the case in Harlem.”
M’baye also wasn’t pleased to see tourists snapping photos of the sign. “I just don’t like that it’s so prevalent. He didn’t have anything up about \[former President\] Bush,” she said. “I would be very happy if it came down. This is actually nicer than what he had before.”An earlier sign read: “A TALIBAN MUSLIM ILLEGALLY ELECTED PRESIDENT USA: HUSSEIN.”
Pastor James David Manning of the ATLAH World Missionary Church.
Manning hasn’t been quiet about his displeasure with President Obama: He and his congregation of about 100 protested outside the President’s fund-raiser at the nearby Red Rooster restaurant in March.In his office, a sign directly behind Manning’s desk reads: “Mr. Obama, Show us your Birth Certificate, Please.”
And the pastor didn’t back down when the Daily News talked to him inside his office.”It’s all right to criticize Obama,” Manning said. “That’s why I put that out there.
“I don’t see anything about Obama that represents he has any concern whatsoever about black people,” said Manning. “We need to stop \[the idea that\] just because someone is black they can’t do any wrong.”
As Manning posed for photos under the sign, he was confronted by a ticked-off resident. “You put that up there?” asked Risden Clare, 32.Manning responded, “Yes, sir.”"I’m ashamed of it!” Clare told the pastor.
O’Neal Mackey couldn’t help from shaking his head as he walked past the sign. “I wouldn’t advertise that on a church,” said Mackey, 38. “Church is supposed to be about spreading love.”
Mary Hidalgo, 33, who lives near the church, called the sign “crazy.” But she tried to make sense of it.
“Maybe [Manning] expected more from Obama than what he’s done so far,” she said. “I was shocked when I saw that. I couldn’t believe it. It’s very disrespectful.”

Pit bull advocate killed by her pit bull

Darla Napora was a member of Bay Area Dog Lovers Responsible About Pit Bulls, a group that does its best to convince people that pit bulls aren’t really that dangerous. When her husband Greg left their Pacifica, California home the other day, his pregnant wife was sleeping…
​In bed with her were the couple’s two pit bulls, Gunner and Tazi. But when he returned home, he was given cause to believe that their whole pit-bulls-aren’t-that-dangerous thing might be something of a misnomer. 
He found his wife covered in blood with Gunner bloody and hovering over her. Greg called an ambulance and got Gunner into the back yard. But it was too late to save Darla. She died at the scene. 
While medics worked to save her, Gunner escaped from the back yard. Police decided to shoot him multiple times after the dog approached them. 
But Greg is still holding onto his pit bulls aren’t dangerous thing. He’s forgiven the dog, even though it killed his wife and his baby-to-be. He plans to bury Darla with Gunner’s ashes.
Editor’s Note: There is not enough forgiveness in the world as it is today.But there is no way I could ever forgive such a thing even though I have owned 3 pits in my life.My prayers go out to the Napora family and friends.

7 year old chokes to death from super ball
by phillhillusa


A seven-year-old girl choked to death when a small rubber ball bounced from the floor into her mouth in a freak accident.
The little girl had been playing with the ball bought by her mother when the ‘chance in a million’ tragedy happened at the family home.
Despite desperate attempts by Kiran Mir’s parents to dislodge the ball, it was stuck in her throat, blocking her airway.
Her devastated father, Shahid Mir, told how he and his wife thumped her on the back and performed the Heimlich manoeuvre in a bid to dislodge the ball, but it wouldn’t move.
Kiran was rushed to hospital but died two days later. An inquest ruled that Kiran died as a result of a tragic accident.Birmingham Corner Aidan Cotter said: ‘Anyone who has children, grandchildren, nephews and nieces knows that something like this can happen.’I cannot believe there is not a single parent who has not had to fish something out of a child’s mouth. It was a completely freak accident.’
Speaking at the family’s home in Saltley, Birmingham, Mr Mir said his daughter’s death had ‘killed all my happiness’.He said he, his wife Shakeela Bibi, aged 34, and their son Faris, aged ten, and daughters Danya, nine, and Laiba, three, had all been left devastated by the death.
Mr Mir, aged 45, who works as a manager at voluntary organisation East Birmingham Community Forum, said he was at work when the tragedy happened on March 1 this year.
In a statement read out to the inquest, Mrs Bibi said the day before she had bought two small rubber balls for Kiran and one for her other children, paying 20p each for them.
She said the following day she had collected her children from school, taken them back home and was changing their clothes. 
Mrs Bibi said: ‘She was bouncing the ball between her hand and the floor. I suddenly heard Kiran cough and immediately looked towards her.’She said her daughter continued to cough and that she suspected Kiran may have swallowed the ball.
She added: ‘I immediately approached her and used one hand to smack her gently two or three times between her shoulder blades hoping for the ball to pop out.’However, she said, Kiran’s lips started to turn blue and she could see she was having difficulty breathing.
Mrs Bibi said she took her daughter to the bathroom and that Kiran had tried to vomit. She then took her back in the living room and made further attempts to get the ball out, but realised that matters had gone beyond her control and phoned her husband.
Speaking at their home, Mr Mir said he told his colleague to call for an ambulance while he rushed home.He said: ‘Me and my wife carried on trying to dislodge the ball by hitting her on the back of the throat and also putting our arms around her chest and back and pulling upwards.
‘By now the ambulance came and they took over. In the ambulance Kiran had a cardiac arrest but the paramedics managed to get her heart started again.
‘When she got to Heartlands her heart had been stopped for 29 minutes and they told us she had suffered brain damage so was transferred to another hospital in Stoke-on-Trent. It’s just terrible, terrible. It’s killed all my happiness.’ 
Mr Mir said his daughter was in intensive care overnight but the following day doctors said the brain damage was so severe she would never recover.He added: ‘Then we had to make the difficult decision to turn off the life support machine.’I was really reluctant to do so but they said that way she could pass away in a dignified way.’
‘She was always very cheerful, a really happy and loving little girl. We miss her every day – especially her sister who was also her friend and they were always playing together.’
He said Kiran was also a popular motivated pupil at school and all the teachers and fellow pupils had been left devastated. At the inquest Mr Cotter recorded a verdict that Kiran had died as a result of an accident.He said: ‘I do not want people to think Kiran deliberately put it in her mouth. I am satisfied this was an unhappy chance in a million where the ball just bounced straight into her mouth.
‘It is quite clear from the evidence that Kiran was being well supervised at the time. This happened while her mother and her other children were in the same room. It happened in a moment.’As soon as it happened her mother did everything that one could hope that they could do. It was simply too far down for anybody to do anything.
‘There are occasions when coroners can make useful recommendations to try and prevent similar accidents in the future but I do not feel that this is one of those occasions.’
Mr Mir said a memorial bench had been put in the gardens of Shaw Hill Primary School in Alum Rock, where his daughter was a pupil.

Mom sends little kids shoplift
by phillhillusa



As these young children wander into a local newsagents, they look like they’re just eager to grab a fizzy drink.
But as the CCTV video continues, it becomes clear that the tiny pair are actually shoplifters – and apparently aged just six and four.
The girl and boy sneak into the shop in Liverpool, apparently on the orders of their mother who waits outside, and fill their arms with sweets and fizzy drinks.
At one point the boy, who is barely eye level with a 3ft high shelf of cereal bars, peeks behind the aisle as a look-out while the older girl, who is too short to reach a can of energy drink Red Bull, has to clamber onto a fridge.
The shop owner Sammi Mohammed passed the heartbreaking footage to the Liverpool Echo.
The girl can be seen grabbing her haul and then turning towards the door, where Mr Mohammed heard her shout: ‘This one mum?’.
Copying his older accomplice, the younger boy helps himself to sweets and snacks, before they both dash out of the door and, apparently, into the arms of their demanding mother.A shocked customer looks on in disbelief as the pair brazenly help themselves.
The pair targeted Mr Mohammed’s shop shortly after 1.45pm on Tuesday while he had a number of customers during the busy lunchtime period.Mr Mohammed said: ‘I just fear for the future for those kids if they grow up thinking that is OK, that is a normal thing to do. 
‘I had customers in the shop and by the time I’d got out they were long gone.
‘What could I have done anyway, they were small children?’The shopkeeper said he believes they were no more than six and four in age.
The astonished shopkeeper told the girl to get down, but she just ignored him and carried on in her quest for the can of drink.He then followed the children as they ran out of the shop, called Muskars on Dale Street in Liverpool city centre, with their spoils, but was too late.
Mr Mohammed, 31, said it was the first time he’d seen children being instructed to steal to order in five years in retail.He said: ‘If this is how they are behaving now, what sort of teenagers and adults will they turn into?’ 
Mr Mohammed said the episode shows there is something deeply wrong in certain sections of society.He said: ‘What hope is there for those kids if the parents are bringing them up to steal? 
‘We saw all those problems with the riots a couple of weeks back – in 10 years time if it happens again, they will be two of the looters because they won’t have learned that it is wrong to steal. 
‘Something needs to be done to give those children a chance. The value of the items isn’t much, but the way they did it just shows how damaged some people are in Britain today.’

Doctors abandon man during surgery
by phillhillusa



A man in China died on the operating table after his doctors fled from a fire that broke out in the next room, a hospital official said Friday.
The unnamed 50-year-old died after being left unattended for 30 minutes while undergoing surgery to amputate his leg on Wednesday night at the Shanghai No. 3 People’s Hospital, said hospital spokeswoman Hu Yuan.
A nurse at first tried to douse the blaze, caused by a disinfecting machine that caught fire but when that failed, the staff attending the patient reported the fire and tried to carry on with the operation.
‘As they were finishing up, the power went out and then they all left,’ Hu said.Firefighters prevented the doctors from returning to the operating room, and by the time they reached the man in the operating room he was dead, apparently of smoke inhalation.
Hu said the doctors and nurses were kept at the hospital as police investigated but were allowed to leave today.’Our hospital gave them some time off,’ Hu added. ‘We did wrong and we are responsible for the whole accident.’
The hospital was discussing compensation for the family, but Hu would not say how much it might pay.

Lazy Cop jailed for refusing to arrest robber
by phillhillusa



A police officer who failed to arrest a convicted thief because she ‘could not be bothered’ was yesterday jailed for a year.
Constable Michele Selby confiscated tools from a man who claimed he was fixing a Chinese restaurant’s door in the early hours of the morning.
She told the man, who had six previous convictions, that she knew he was trying to break in and if she did not have another call to go to he would have gone to jail.
However, the job she was rushing to was not a 999 call but delivering letters to another police station.
At a hearing at Glasgow Sheriff Court last month, Selby was found guilty of attempting to defeat the ends of justice.Selby, 38, of Cumbernauld, Dunbartonshire, had told the court she believed the man was fixing the door and that no crime had been committed.
Passing sentence yesterday, Sheriff Richard Clark told Selby: ‘I recognise that the effect of this conviction is catastrophic for you. I also recognise that prior to the commission you were held in high regard in society.
‘Nevertheless, having regard to the factors, I am satisfied that a custodial sentence is the only appropriate disposal in this case.’
The court had heard earlier from PC Mechelle Maley, 23, who had been on duty with Selby at 5.30am on July 26 in Kirkintilloch, Dunbartonshire.
PC Maley said she brought her colleague’s attention to the man who was outside the Moon River Chinese restaurant and they went to speak to him.
She spotted a red-handled screwdriver, crowbar and wrench and thought the man looked as though he was trying to break in. The court heard Selby took the man’s details and did a background check.
PC Maley said: ‘She told him, we know you are trying to break in and if we didn’t have another call to go to you would be getting the jail.’
Prosecutor Andrew Beadsworth asked the witness: ‘What, if anything, was said after that?’She answered: ‘She said we would be taking the tools from him.’The officer added that they then returned to their police car and the man walked away.
Asked if she had spoken to Selby about the incident, she replied: ‘When we got in the car, she said if she could be bothered he would have got the jail, or words to that effect.’
The court heard she asked Selby what job they had been given and was told that it was delivering post.Selby then dumped the tools in a bin at Kirkintilloch Police Station before clocking off duty at 7am.
PC Maley told the court she did not feel confident enough to challenge Selby’s decision to let the man go or to throw away the tools but later reported it to her superiors.In her evidence, Selby claimed she did not see a crowbar or wrench at the door of the restaurant, only screwdrivers, a hammer and a box of nails.
She told the court: ‘I didn’t believe a crime had been committed.’
Asked by defence lawyer Callum Anderson why she took the tools, the defendant replied: ‘To see what his answer would be – but he was freely saying I could take the tools.’
She added: ‘I made a mistake, it wasn’t intentional, it wasn’t wilful, it wasn’t evil. I didn’t start my shift and say I’m going to defeat the ends of justice today.’
Mr Anderson told the court his client’s actions were not for financial or personal gain and that it was an ‘isolated incident’.
He added: ‘If the accused had acted differently and detained the man, then she probably would have received financial benefit for that in the form of overtime.’
Selby was found guilty of attempting to defeat the ends of justice by failing to detain the man and disposing of his tools and failing to investigate the incident on July 26 last year.
She has since resigned from Strathclyde Police.

Egypt declares war on bikinis and pyramids
by phillhillusa


More zealous Muslims demand cover-up of pharaonic monuments, too Sunbathing in Alexandria may soon be a thing of the past, at least if some Egyptian Islamist politicians have their way. Egypt’s tourism industry has suffered a severe blow since the outburst of anti-regime demonstrations in January. But that did not stop the Freedom and Justice Party, the political wing of the Muslim Brotherhood, from demanding stricter regulations over what tourists can do and wear while visiting the country. The party is urging officials to ban skimpy swimwear and the consumption of alcohol on Egyptian streets. “Beach tourism must take the values and norms of our society into account,” Muhammad Saad Al-Katatny, secretary-general of Freedom and Justice, told Egyptian tourism officials on Monday. “We must place regulations on tourists wishing to visit Egypt, which we will announce in advance.” The call for new strictures on tourists comes as Egypt debates the role of Islam in the post-Mubarak era. Freedom and Justice is competing in elections scheduled for this autumn for parliament and opinion polls show a majority of Egyptians favor a greater use of Islamic law and mores. But a vocal minority worries that Egypt risks becoming an Islamic republic. “This is how things began in Iran,” Hani Henry, a psychology professor at the American University in Cairo, told The Media Line. “The moderate youth wanted to implement changes, but the Mullah’s hijacked the revolution. The same thing is now happening here in Egypt with the Muslim Brotherhood. It makes me sick to my stomach.” Along with Suez Canal tolls and energy exports, tourism is a major source of foreign exchange for Egypt. But with protests, strikes, and continued violence in the cities and Sinai Peninsula months after President Husni Mubarak was forced to step down, foreigners have hesitated to visit the country, which offers some of the world’s most spectacular antiquities as well as beaches and scuba diving.  Finance Minister Hazem Al-Beblawi told the Reuters news agency earlier this month that revenue from tourism would likely total $10 billion in the financial year that started on July 1, compared with $11.6 billion in 2009/10. Al-Katatny told Al-Masry Al-Youm daily that his party had already set up a subcommittee to investigate the issue of incoming tourism to Egypt and planned to amend legislation following the upcoming parliamentary elections. “Some slight changes will be made in public beaches, to make the situation better than it was before,” Ali Khafagy, youth director of Freedom and Justice in Giza, told The Media Line. “Bathing suits and mixing on the beach are things that go against our tradition. It’s not just a matter of religion. When I go to the beach I don’t want to see nudity.”He said modest bathing gear or separate beaches for men and women are possible alternatives to the current situation. Khafagy stressed that tourists would be free to do as they please in specially designated areas, adding that his party supported incoming tourism to the country. But that did not satisfy the heads of Egypt’s tourism industry, who met with the party’s secretary-general Al-Katatny for a heated debate on Monday.  “Without alcohol and bathing suits, no tourists will come and we will loose $13 billion a year,” Hussam A-Shaer, head of the tourist company association, told Al-Masry al-Youm. But bathing suits are not the only worry of Egypt’s Islamists. Abd Al-Munim A-Shahhat, a spokesman for the Salafi group Dawa, has said that Egypt’s world-renowned pharaonic archeology – its pyramids, Sphinx and other monuments covered with un-Islamic imagery – should also be hidden from the public eye. “The pharaonic culture is a rotten culture,” A-Shahhat told the London-based Arab daily A-Sharq Al-Awsat on Wednesday, saying the faces of ancient statues “should be covered with wax, since they are religiously forbidden.” He likened the Egyptian relics to the idols which circled the walls of Mecca in pre-Islamic times.  The Islamist challenges to the tourism industry in post-revolutionary Egypt have led to the establishment of the Coalition to Support Tourism, whose members also met with Al-Katatny on Monday. The coalition, which includes a broad array of travel industry organizations and figures, argued that the real problem isn’t modesty but the absence of any strategy on the part of Egypt’s new parties to protect the country’s faltering tourism industry. “Some parties want to ban tourism, or allow it while banning alcohol, certain foods and certain clothes. [A couple] renting a room will require documents proving they are married,” wrote the coalition administrator on the group’s Facebook page. “These proposals don’t bode well, as many of you know.” Henry of the American University said two classes of beaches already exist in Egypt, with modestly dressed, generally poor Egyptians occupying some and foreign tourists occupying others, mostly in the resorts of the Sinai Peninsula. He said he considered imposition of sharia law in Egypt “an act of aggression” that he would not tolerate. Islamists have never been enamored of foreign tourism and before they were crushed by the Mubarak regime foreign visitors were often targeted for killings. Close to 60 Western tourists were killed by Islamist terrorists in the southern city of Luxor in 1997. Tourists were also attacked in bombings in the Sinai resorts of Taba, Sharm Al-Sheikh and Dahab in 2004, 2005 and 2006.But Al-Kantatny said that the Muslim Brotherhood regards Egypt’s archeology as belonging to all of humanity, and should therefore be safeguarded. “This heritage belongs to everyone, and one can’t simply remove something he doesn’t like,” he told Al-Ahram daily.

Mexico’s Calderon blames U.S. after casino attack
by phillhillusa



President Felipe Calderon declared three days of mourning on Friday and demanded a crackdown on drugs in the United States after armed men torched a casino in northern Mexico, killing at least 52 people.
Under intense pressure as violence soars, Calderon said he would send more federal security forces to the city of Monterrey, where gunmen set fire to an upmarket casino on Thursday in one of the worst attacks of Mexico’s drug war.
Lashing out at corrupt officials in Mexico and “insatiable” U.S. demand for drugs for fomenting the violence, Calderon urged the U.S. Congress to stamp out drug consumption and stop illegal trafficking of weapons across the border into Mexico.
“We’re neighbors, we’re allies, we’re friends, but you are also responsible,” a somber and angry Calderon said to the United States in a speech after meeting his security advisers.
President Barack Obama called the attack “barbaric” and said his government stood shoulder to shoulder with Mexico in the battle against the gangs.

Washington provides money and resources to Mexico in the drug war, but joint cooperation has been damaged by mistrust, a botched U.S. plan to track down weapons smugglers and the killing by suspected hitmen of a U.S. customs agent in Mexico this year.
Pledging to step up the fight on organized crime, Calderon said Mexico was under attack from “true terrorists,” and told all Mexicans to come forward and denounce those responsible.
But the drug war is becoming increasingly unpopular as more citizens are caught in the crossfire of sparring cartels.
Mexicans took to social networks to call for a candle-lit protest for peace outside the casino in Monterrey, as well as a gathering at Mexico City’s Angel of Independence monument.
More than 375 people had joined a Facebook page “Casino Royale Monterrey everyone united against terrorism” by late on Friday, writing a string of comments denouncing the violence.

Mount Charleston Raid Yields Marijuana Worth $23.4M
by phillhillusa



Federal forest agents and Las Vegas-area police say they removed more than $23.4 million worth of marijuana plants from a Nevada mountainside in one of the first reported cases of outdoor pot farms in the Silver State.
Authorities said Thursday the raid removed nearly 4,700 marijuana plants from Mount Charleston, about 45 miles northwest of downtown Las Vegas.
No suspects were found and no arrests were made during the Wednesday operation.
Illegal marijuana farms have been found on public land in California and other states. But authorities say they were unheard of in Nevada’s desert landscape until recently.
Officials say the grove on Mount Charleston was spotted several months ago when officials were airlifting an injured hiker.

Squirrel Blamed for Flag Thefts From Ohio Memorial
by phillhillusa



TOLEDO –  Police in Ohio have discovered that small flags being swiped from a police memorial were being squirreled away.
Two Toledo officers watched on Wednesday as a squirrel quickly snatched a flag off its wooden dowel and ran off with it. Lt. James Brown told The Blade newspaper the bushy-tailed critter was too quick to catch.
Later, police noticed a squirrel hanging out on a tree branch outside a third-floor window at their headquarters building. They also spotted a squirrel’s nest made of leaves and branches — and at least two of the little flags.
Brown says at least three of the flags have gone missing in recent days.
He’s careful to point out he can’t prove all were the work of the same squirrel.

East Coast Bracing for Irene’s Fury
by phillhillusa



Thousands are fleeing coastal North Carolina and a state of emergency has been declared in Virginia ahead of a powerful Category 3 hurricane that pounded the Bahamas before turning its eye toward the U.S. East Coast.
Hurricane Irene could hit North Carolina’s Outer Banks on Saturday afternoon, packing winds up to 115 miles per hour, and forecasters say it’s expected to strengthen into a monstrous Category 4 as it chugs toward the U.S., potentially wrecking havoc as far away as New England.   
The U.S. is preparing to get hit by Hurricane Irene which strengthened to a major Category 3 storm over the Bahamas on Wednesday. Evacuations began on a tiny barrier island off North Carolina as Irene has the East Coast in its sights.
 The storm has already killed at least three people in the Dominican Republican and forced 38,000 others in the country to evacuate their homes, according to local reports. 
In North Carolina, about 180,000 tourists and residents in coastal Dare County have been told to leave, and forecasters issued a hurricane watch for much of the state’s coast. To the north in Virginia, dozens of Navy ships began leaving their port to ride out the storm at sea. And emergency officials all the way to New England were urging residents in low-lying areas to gather supplies and learn the way to a safe location.
“We’re getting prepared … we’re asking everybody to have three days of water, three days of food,” Florida Gov. Rick Scott told Fox News. “We’ve got a lot of experience with this.”
As the sun rose over the barrier islands in North Carolina on Thursday, tourists packed suitcases in their cars, while locals stocked up on food, water and gas. Traffic was moving briskly Thursday morning on the two-lane highway that cuts through many of the coastal communities, but many feared that would change.

“It’s going to be a mess,” said 66-year-old Buxton resident Leon Reasor as he stood inside a local bait shop. “Anyone who tells you they’re not worried is a liar.”
An evacuation order for an estimated 150,000 visitors took effect Thursday in Dare County, while its 35,000 permanent residents were told to begin leaving the next day.
“It wouldn’t behoove anyone to stay in these circumstances,” Dare County emergency management spokeswoman Sharon Sullivan said. “Businesses are boarding up. Nobody can guarantee their safety.”
Craig Fugate, the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, has urged people to find out if they are in an area that could need to evacuate, figure out which local official would give the order and pay attention to local broadcasters for that information. Among the most important tasks, he said, was figuring out a safe place to go before hitting the road.
All along the East Coast, officials were calculating what they needed to do as Irene continued its march across the Caribbean toward the U.S. 
Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell on Thursday declared a state of emergency ahead of Irene’s weekend arrival. The declaration allows state resources, such as the National Guard, to be sent to Hampton Roads to help local officials.
McDonnell said he did not plan to order a statewide evacuation or reverse lanes on Interstate 64. But he cautioned eastern Virginia residents who live in low-lying areas to be ready in case of a local evacuation.
In New York City, Mayor Michael Bloomberg urged residents living in low-lying areas on Thursday to line up a place to stay on high ground ahead of possible evacuations this weekend. He said he would make a decision by late Friday on whether to evacuate neighborhoods along the water in several boroughs.

Early Thursday, the storm was slamming the Bahamas with widespread damage reported on at least two southern islands.
While the storm’s path isn’t definite, officials are taking nothing for granted.
In Maryland, inspections of bridges looking for cracks in the support piers and other structural features found no damage, according to state transportation agency spokeswoman Teri Moss. In Virginia, with a southeastern corner that could be in Irene’s way, cities along the coast are reviewing their evacuation plans, said Laura Southard, spokeswoman for the state Department of Emergency Management.
North Carolina’s Outer Banks, which look the likeliest to get a serious hit from Irene, have a long history of hurricanes, and building codes and emergency plans reflect that. Structures in the region are designed to withstand up to 110 mph sustained winds and gusts of up to 130 mph for three minutes. Evacuation routes are meticulously planned, down to the order in which counties hit the road.

Ocracoke Island, a tiny Outer Banks community, has already ordered visitors off, but it has special challenges since it’s only accessible to the mainland by boat.
Some of the region’s most popular destinations rely on the ailing Bonner Bridge, which was built in 1963 and intended to last 30 years, to connect Hatteras Island to the northern Outer Banks. There’s no other way to reach Hatteras except by boat.
The bridge handles about 2 million cars a year and the state DOT ranks it a 2 on its safety meter, with 100 being the highest, or most safe, designation.
“We’re going to shift people and resources around to do what we need to do and keep the roads open,” said North Carolina Department of Transportation spokeswoman Nicole Meister. The 2.7-mile bridge won’t stay open if it’s deemed unsafe — which happened during Hurricane Earl last year — but the state has an emergency ferry terminal ready in that case to get people off the island, Meister said.
Farther north, precautions so far were mainly wait-and-see as officials watched for developments in the forecast.
New York City officials had begun preparations to evacuate residents from low-lying areas of the city if necessary. The city’s subway stations and tunnels would likely be flooded in places, and officials plan to shut the system down ahead of time to reduce damage to the infrastructure.
“The sense is that we’re going to be facing a strong tropical storm” with winds of 40 to 60 mph, said Office of Emergency Management Commissioner Joseph F. Bruno.
But Bruno added that the city’s agencies were preparing for a Category 1 hurricane with winds surpassing 74 mph and waters surging dangerously in low-lying areas. With five hospitals and nursing homes in the area, officials were readying to possibly evacuate the most frail and needy.

Roads and bridges in Massachusetts are likely to bear the weather in good condition, said Peter Judge, a spokesman for the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency. But the agency is planning for flooding and is keeping an eye on the 3,000 public and private dams throughout the state.
Meanwhile, a new tropical depression formed far out over the Atlantic on Thursday, with the National Hurricane Center saying it would likely become a tropical storm later in the day.

Austrian Sexually Abused Mentally Disabled Daughters for 41 Years
by phillhillusa


Outside view of the house in St. Peter am Hart, Upper Austria, taken on Thursday, Aug. 25, 2011, where police are investigating allegations that a man imprisoned his two mentally retarded daughters and sexually abused them for 41 years. They say that the now-80-year old repeatedly raped the women between 1970 and May 2011. The alleged victims are now 53 and 45.
VIENNA –  An 80-year-old man was arrested Thursday on suspicion of locking up his two mentally disabled daughters in a small room for 41 years, sexually abusing them, and beating and threatening them to keep them subservient.
Alois Lissl, a senior state police official, said the father — from the Upper Austrian village of St. Peter am Hart — is suspected of assault, torture or neglect of defenseless individuals, threat to life or physical condition, rape and other sex crimes. The man had been at liberty and living in a senior citizens’ home.
March 19, 2009: Josef Fritzl stands in the courtroom prior to the proclamation of the verdict at the provincial courthouse in St. Poelten, Austria. The liquidator of Josef Fritzl’s estate says the basement of the house where Fritzl imprisoned and repeatedly raped his daughter for 24 years will be filled up with concrete.

Lissl said the man will be questioned by an investigative judge within the next 48 hours, who will decide whether to keep him confined.
Police said the man’s daughters — now 53 and 45 years old — have accused him of repeatedly raping them at their home between 1970 and May 2011. The women said their father repeatedly warned he would kill them if they resisted, occasionally threatening them with firearms, said Lissl.
They also said that their mother, who died several years ago, was also repeatedly abused by the suspect.
The father has denied the accusations, said local police commander Martin Pumberger. Police have not named him or the alleged victims.
The Oberoesterreichische Nachrichten newspaper reported that the women escaped from their father’s custody when he fell and was unable to get up after the older daughter pushed him during an attempted rape. It said the victims were also beaten with a stick and a pitchfork.

It was unclear why it took for so long for the allegations to surface.
Police were initially quoted as saying the daughters did not tell anyone about the alleged abuse until weeks after their escape. But authorities later said that a social worker who discovered the father two days after he fell went to police shortly after with her suspicions. The man was moved to the senior citizens’ home after he was found.
The allegations evoke chilling parallels to the case of Austrian Josef Fritzl, who imprisoned his daughter in a windowless cellar for 24 years and repeatedly raped her, fathering her seven children. Fritzl was sentenced to life imprisonment two years ago for that crime and for responsibility in the death of one of the children.

9 Chicago Gang Members Arrested for Allegedly Selling Girls for Sex
by phillhillusa



Nine Chicago gang members have been arrested for allegedly selling young girls and teens for sex in what authorities have described as a massive human trafficking investigation, MyFoxChicago.com reports.
Cook County State’s Attorney Anita Alvarez said the probe was the first in the nation to use state wiretaps to track the alleged offenders running the sex trade, according to the station.
A 35-page police affidavit, called “Little Girl Lost,” reportedly states that girls as young as 12 were part of the sex ring.
The girls were allegedly drugged, beaten and threatened by gang members, the station reports. Some endured face slashings and were forced into the trunks of cars for long periods of time as punishment, according to authorities. 
“I’ve worked approximately 23 years in sheriff’s department, the last 12 I’ve done child exploitation crimes and this is the worst with what we’ve seen, the beatings, the manipulation, the violence involved,” Mike Anton of the Cook County Sheriff’s Department told the station.
“In one case, we saw where a 13-year-old girl was sold from one pimp to another for $100 and what we’ve noticed is gang members are loosely connected to each other and sell girls to each other,” added Alvarez.

Qaddafi has Big Crush Condoleezza Rice
by phillhillusa



Could a lovestruck dictator be the reason why Libya abandoned its weapons of mass destruction program?
The evidence is thin, but Muammar al-Qaddafi appears to have had a crush on Condoleezza Rice, at least that’s what a find by rebels at Qaddafi’s Tripoli compound have uncovered in the form of a photo album dedicated solely to the former U.S. secretary of state.
Apparently Qaddafi’s adoration of Rice was no secret. 

“Leezza, Leezza, Leezza … I love her very much,” the colonel reportedly told Al Jazeera in 2007, calling her his “darling black African woman.”
Rice had dinner with the despot in 2008 at the compound where the photos were found. At the time, Qaddafi reportedly greeted the secretary of state by putting his hand against his heart, a traditional Arab greeting, but perhaps one more imbued with romance than is the norm.
Qaddafi abandoned his weapons program and accepted responsibility for the 1988 bombing of a plane over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 2003, when Rice was President George W. Bush’s national security adviser. The moves put him in good graces with the Bush administration, which lifted his designation as a foreign sponsor of terrorism. In 2006, the U.S. and Libya established full diplomatic relations.
These days, the besieged dictator, overrun by rebel fighters wanting to liberate the country from his 42 years of ironfisted rule, is nowhere to be found.

PETA will launch XXX porn site
by phillhillusa



 People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals PETA has announced plans to launch a porn site Peta.xxx. the site will
aim to raise awareness of veganism by offering pornographic material alongside graphic footage of animal mistreatment.
 PETA’s sexy ads have always confused me. For example, Pamela Anderson’s butcher diagram poster above elicits a variety of provocative questions, almost none of which have to do with animal rights. 
“Is it wrong to treat a woman as ‘a piece of meat’ even if she seems to have based her whole career around exploiting her exterior assets?” comes to mind first, followed by, “Is Pamela Anderson seriously 44? I wonder what her workout routine is,” and then, “What does Pamela Anderson taste like?” 
These all come pop into my head before what I assume PETA was going for with the ad. Although I’m still not quite sure what that is, I think it must be something along the lines of: “People are animals too. Doesn’t that make eating animals wrong?” To which I would quickly answer, “Well, no. Not really.”

PETA’s most recent move, though, manages to be even more confusing than the butcher diagram poster. Apparently the activist organization has registered PETA.XXX with the intention of launching a porn site to raise awareness for vegetarianism. 
PETA spokeswoman Lindsay Rajt spoke to Huffington Post  about the organization’s plans for their new website. “We live in a 24 hour news cycle world and we learn the racy things we do are sometimes the most effective way that we can reach particular individuals,” said Rajt.
“We really want to grab people’s attention, get them talking and to question the status quo and ultimately take action, because the best way we can help the greatest number of animals is simply by not eating them,” she went on.

Up to here, PETA’s idea of porn for animal rights vaguely makes sense—the organization is essentially taking the advertising aphorism “sex sells” in the most literal way possible by using actual sex to sell their ideology. 
That’s all fine until you consider what the Herald Sun reported about the site’s actual content: “PETA’s sexy side displayed in galleries and videos will quickly give way to the sinister world of animal mistreatment uncovered by the group’s hidden camera investigations in a very different kind of graphic content.”
Apparently they are planning to juxtapose porn with images of mistreated animals. For any sane person, images of mistreated animals should be an instant boner-killer. This prompts more confusion:

Is PETA pro-animal rights, or anti-sex? By tapping into the porn industry aren’t they essentially exploiting one famously messed up industry to try to save the victims of another? And if they’re intentionally using sex to sell, why would they create a website that will undoubtedly kill sex for anyone who goes there? 
Are they trying to save animals by making it harder for people to reproduce?

Mom gets stillborn baby’s remains in envelope
by phillhillusa



A British mother has received damages from a hospital where a receptionist handed her an envelope containing skin and tissue from her stillborn baby.
“I can’t believe anybody could be so unfeeling as to behave in this way,” Danielle Tivey, 27, said in a statement reported by the Daily Mirror Tuesday.
The newspaper said she had to fight for eight months to get the remains of her son Tommy, who was stillborn, when she gave birth to his healthy twin, Alfy, in January 2007 at Southend Hospital in Essex.She received “substantial damages,” the Mirror said, but did not disclose the amount.
Tivey, of Canvey Island, Essex, was told of Tommy’s death after an ultrasound about a month before she was to give birth and later told doctors she wanted his remains so he could be given a funeral.But the hospital lost forms in which she said she wanted the remains.
She received remains when a hospital receptionist handed her a brown envelope containing skin and tissue samples encased in six wax blocks.Tivey said she became sickened and suffered nightmares.
“This demonstrates quite appalling incompetence and insensitivity by the hospital,” said James Sherwin, a medical negligence specialist with Attwaters solicitors, which handled the case.
In a statement, the hospital said an apology was delivered to the family “for the insensitive management of their bereavement.”
The hospital says it has revised bereavement services, information processes and counseling.

Bloomberg bans the Church from 9/11 ceremony
by phillhillusa



Religious leaders are calling on Mayor Michael Bloomberg to reverse course and offer clergy a role in the ceremony commemorating the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center.
 Rudy Washington, a deputy mayor in former Mayor Rudolph Giuliani’s administration, said he’s outraged. Mr. Washington organized an interfaith ceremony at Yankee Stadium shortly after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

 “This is America, and to have a memorial service where there’s no prayer, this appears to be insanity to me,” said Mr. Washington, who has suffered severe medical problems connected to the time he spent at Ground Zero.
Editrs Note:Bloomberg bans religion from the 9/11 Memmorial Ceremony yet,stands up for the building of a mosque next to the Twin Tower’s Site.
This seems to look like Bloomberg could possibly be in thr pocket of the Muslim Brotherhoods front organization Cair.Think about it.

The girl said she had been sexually active with Bouchard’s husband, Matthew, while Bouchard was present, the complaint notes.
Bouchard’s husband has been in jail since November, according to local station WJHG.
Matthew Bouchard faces charges of sexual battery and child abuse, according to The Daily Mail.
His wife is charged with being a principal to sexual battery, soliciting sexual activity with a child and principal to child abuse.

Octomom Wins Celebrity Boxing Match In Florida
by phillhillusa



Remember Octomom? The mother of octuplets fought to keep her name in the news on Saturday by winning a so-called celebrity boxing match against a strip club bartender in Florida. 
Nadya Suleman who had six previous children before the well-known litter of eight more babies in 2009 donned a pair of oversized boxing gloves and a revealing black leotard for the main event at a Fort Lauderdale resort, The South Florida Sun-Sentinel reported. 
Octomom’s opponent Cassandra Andersen, a bartender at the Playhouse Gentleman’s Club, went toe-to-toe with Suleman for three 60-second rounds. Actually, she outlasted Suleman who jumped out of the ring with several seconds to go before the final bell rung, The Miami Herald said.
In the end, the judges — in a split decision — decided that the mommy of many had won the bout. 
The audience of roughly three dozen paid $25 a pop to watch the two vixens throw punches, push and head-butt each other inside the squared circle, The Herald said.
Celebrity Boxing Federation owner Danny Feldman tried to whet whatever appetite there is among the genreal public to watch formerly well-known personalities duke it out with giant boxing gloves. He announced, according to The Sun-Sentinel, there will be a fight between Long Island philanderer Joey Buttafuoco and Rodney King. Famed O.J. Simpson freeloader Kato Kaelin will take on Michael Lohan, father of troubled celeb Lindsay Lohan, in an upcoming Los Angeles match. 
Octomom committed to four fights with Celebrity Boxing and might challenge former wrestler Chyna in her next fight, NBC Miami said.

Forecasters Say Irene Could Become Category 4
by phillhillusa


A hurricane watch is issued for the North Carolina coast as Irene has already caused two deaths in the Dominican Republic and ‘disturbing’ damage in the Bahamas, and forecasters say its winds could increase quickly over the next day as the hurricane moves toward the U.S.
The National Hurricane Center has issued the first hurricane watch for the outer islands of North Carolina as Hurricane Irene marches toward the U.S. coast.
Early Thursday, the center said Irene is approaching the northwestern Bahamas as a Category 3 storm with maximum sustained winds at 115 mph but the storm could become a category 4 hurricane by Thursday.
The head of the National Emergency Management Agency in the Bahamas said he received what he calls disturbing initial reports of damages from two southern islands that were some of the first to be hit as the storm approached the archipelago.
Capt. Stephen Russell tells The Associated Press that at least two settlements have been devastated on Acklins and Crooked islands. Russells says an official there reports that 90 percent of the homes in the settlements have been severely damaged or destroyed. Several hundred people live on each island. No injuries have been reported.
Forecasters say Irene’s winds could increase quickly over the next day as the storm moves farther on its path toward the U.S.
Hurricane and tropical storm watches will likely be required for parts of the southeastern U.S. coast by early Thursday, but officials in North Carolina’s coastal Dare County have already ordered as many as 150,000 tourists to leave beginning that morning.

Russian Supply Ship Crash Could Delay New Space Station Crew
by phillhillusa



CAPE CANAVERAL –  The failed launch of a Russian supply ship may have ripple effects at the International Space Station.
A spacecraft carrying nearly 3 tons of supplies failed to reach orbit Wednesday and crashed into Siberia.
NASA’s space station program manager, Mike Suffredini, says next month’s planned launch of a new crew may be delayed. That’s because the upper stage of the Soyuz rocket that failed is similar to the ones used to launch astronauts.
Suffredini says three of the six space station astronauts who are due to return to Earth in two weeks, might end up staying longer. NASA wants to keep the outpost fully staffed with six to keep research going.
As for supplies, the space station has plenty to last until spring.

James Van Praagh Offered $1 Million To Prove Mental Powers by the Amazing Randi
by phillhillusa



Self-proclaimed psychic James Van Praagh has certainly done well for himself through doing readings, writing books about the psychic world and helping to create the CBS drama “The Ghost Whisperer.”
Still, even with all his success, you’d think he wouldn’t pass up a chance to earn a quick million bucks, right?
If you predicted yes, your answer would be wrong — at least up to now.
That’s because the James Randi Educational Foundation (JREF) has issued a challenge to Van Praagh and other people who claim to have psychic ability: It will pay $1 million for anyone who can produce evidence of paranormal abilities under controlled conditions. 
It’s not a new deal by any means: The Foundation has made this offer since it was founded in 1996 “to expose charlatans and help people defend themselves from paranormal and pseudoscientific claims.”
So far, no one has been able to collect on the money, not even a well known psychic like Van Praagh, whom the organization is singling out in order to capitalize on his particularly devastating appearance on a recent episode of “ABC’s Primetime Nightline: Beyond Belief,” a one-hour special that explored whether such a thing as psychic ability exist.
During the episode, Van Praagh performed a reading on “Good Morning America” anchor Josh Elliott.
Although Elliott initially appeared surprised by Van Praagh’s accuracy, he revealed that “every talking point of the reading” seemed to have been lifted from a two-year-old interview with Elliott that was available online.
“I’d known there was plenty of information regarding my past readily available with a cursory Internet search, including an extensive interview that included all the talking points [such as] my dead relatives and my adoption,” Elliot said during the show. “Except, I thought, for [my mom's boyfriend] Leo.”
Elliott rechecked that interview when he got home from interviewing Van Praagh and discovered that interview had a reference to Leo’s passing, “able to be exploited along with the rest.”
James Randi Professor and Magician from the James Randi Educational Foundation  
During the show, Van Praagh denied using Google, but declined to do a reading on Elliot’s segment producer, claiming he had become too tired.
In a later part of the show, Allison DuBois, who appeared on Bravo’s “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” and is also billed as the inspiration for the CBS drama “Medium,” performed a similar reading on ABC News correspondent David Wright as did self-proclaimed medium Rebecca Rosen.
Both readings focused on Wright’s family and his late mother. Wright was surprised by their accuracy and said they revealed “details that don’t pop up on Google.”
Yet, shortly after the show aired, a Twitter user posted a link to a wedding announcement from The New York Times that contained the relevant details about the Wright family.
JREF founder James Randi makes no claims of intuitive ability, but his gut tells him that both Van Praagh and DuBois “should be embarrassed by the transparent performances they revealed to the world on last night’s show.”
Randi would like those two — and other psychics — to put their alleged powers to the test under scientific conditions and not rely on “cold reading,” a technique that uses questions to get key points to focus on, for example, through prompts like, “I see a woman with an ‘M’ in her name…?”
Although cold reading in itself isn’t bad — as long as it is labeled as such or presented as a party trick — Randi is disgusted by how Van Praagh and DuBois use it to “prey on families’ deepest fears and regrets,” he said.
To be fair to Van Praagh, there are some academics who claim his powers hold up under scientific scrutiny such as Dr. Gary Schwartz, a former Yale professor now at the University of Arizona.
“I’ve been very impressed,” Schwartz said on the “Primetime Nightline” episode. “He is real and accurate and, on the average, among the best of the mediums I’ve seen.”
Randi may be skeptical about psychic powers in general, but he figures the easiest way to prove him wrong is for real psychics to take up the challenge.
“If anyone does have psychic powers, and can prove it [the money is there],” he said. “I am surprised people aren’t hammering down my door.”
HuffPost Weird News reached out to Van Praagh for a comment about his performance on the ABC show and any plans to take Randi up on the $1 million challenge. So far, there has been no response — something Randi predicted.
“All these guys — Van Praagh, DuBois, Uri Geller — they know we know how to set up a test,” he laughed. “Whenever Uri Geller or Van Praagh are asked about the test, they change the subject.”
Another guy who does “cold readings,” John Edward, was once asked about the challenge and, according to Randi, he said, “I never talk about a guy whose name is also a verb.”
Randy said, “The interviewer laughed and changed the subject.”

Last Known Photos of Missing Maryland Woman in Aruba
by phillhillusa


Aug. 2: In this photo released by the Public Prosecutor of Aruba, Gardner and Giordano are seen leaving the "Rum Reef Restaurant" at Nanki.
ORANJESTAD, Aruba –  The office of the Public Prosecutor of Aruba released Wednesday the last known photographs of missing American tourist Robyn Gardner and renewed pleas for more information about Gary V. Giordano, who is suspected in her disappearance.
The photographs show Gardner and Giordano leaving the Rum Reef Restaurant at Nanki on Aug. 2, the day Gardner disappeared. A photo of the rental car Giordano and Gardner used during their stay in Aruba was also released.
Despite a large-scale search, police have not yet located the remains of the missing 35-year-old Maryland woman or anything that might link Giordano to her disappearance, though he has been detained on suspicion of involvement. He has denied wrongdoing.
Giordano, a 50-year-old business owner from Gaithersburg, Md., traveled to Aruba with Gardner on July 31 and reported her missing two days later, saying she disappeared while the two were snorkeling.

Giordano reportedly purchased a $1.5 million accidental-death insurance policy on Gardner before heading out on the trip, and tried to collect on the plan just two days after Gardner went missing.
A person who provided information to authorities told the AP that Giordano bought the insurance specifically for his five-day getaway with Gardner. The person did not have authorization to publicly release the information and agreed to speak only on condition of anonymity.
Aruban authorities previously confirmed that Giordano had an insurance policy that covered the missing woman, but withheld details, including who the beneficiary is or whether Giordano tried to collect.
A judge ruled Monday there is enough evidence to hold Giordano until at least the end of August on suspicion of involvement in Gardner’s presumed death.
Investigators are seeking to collect enough evidence by the next detention hearing to hold Giordano for another 60 days and proceed to trial. Among the material collected so far, Stein said, are “explicit” photos of Gardner that were stored on Giordano’s camera, which has been confiscated.
Gardner and Giordano's rental car while in Aruba
Stein declined to provide details of the photos, but he said that partial images of Giordano appeared in some of them. Investigators are still trying to determine when the photos were taken.
Investigators have taken a DNA sample from Giordano and sent it to the Netherlands for processing. It will be used to compare with any evidence that might be collected, Stein said.
The FBI, which searched Giordano’s home in an upscale Washington suburb, has been assisting Aruban authorities with the investigation and has put out a missing-person poster with three photographs of the 5-foot-4-inch blonde, including one showing a jungle-print design tattoo on her left shoulder. The poster urges anyone with information about Gardner to contact the FBI or the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate.
The exact nature of the relationship between Gardner, who had a boyfriend back home in Maryland, and Giordano, a twice-divorced father of three sons, isn’t clear, but the prosecutor’s office has said they stayed in a room together at a Marriott hotel in Aruba. Gardner, who is from Frederick, Md., had recently been laid off from her job as a patient care coordinator at a dental office.
Anyone who has seen Giordano and can give information on him, his contacts and places he and Gardner visited during their stay in Aruba is urged to contact the Aruban authorities at 011-297-582-0695.

Baby Thrown from Building Dies, Mother Charged With Attempted Murder
by phillhillusa



ORANGE, Calif.– A 7-month-old baby boy who was tossed from the fourth floor of a hospital parking structure died Wednesday, the same day his mother made an initial court appearance on charges of attempted murder and felony child abuse, a police spokesman said.
The child died Wednesday morning at the University of California, Irvine, Medical Center and charges against the mother, Sonia Hermosillo, 31, will be upgraded to murder, said Sgt. Dan Adams, spokesman for the Orange Police Department.
Prosecutors allege that Hermosillo removed a helmet that her son wore for a medical condition before tossing him from the parking structure at Children’s Hospital of Orange County late Monday. She then went back inside the hospital to validate her parking, senior deputy district attorney Scott Simmons said after Hermosillo’s hearing.
Hermosillo’s husband, Noe Medina, told The Orange County Register in an interview Tuesday that his wife had been hospitalized for postpartum depression in June after she said she didn’t want their son, Noe Medina Jr., who was diagnosed with congenital muscular torticollis — a twisting of the neck to one side.
The infant also wore a helmet to help correct his plagiocephaly, also known as flat-head syndrome, the Register reported.
“She didn’t look at our son as normal,” Medina said. “She didn’t accept him. She didn’t accept that he was like this.”

Medina said the boy was receiving physical therapy twice a week and was showing signs of improvement.
Simmons, the prosecutor, said Hermosillo’s behavior showed she intended to kill her son, regardless of her mental state.
“It’s not like she’s in a fetal position when the police arrived,” he said. “She picks a specific location, drives to the top of the building (and) takes the helmet off. I’m sure she’s depressed, the post-partum blues, I’m sure she had some of that.”
“It’s going to be up to a jury to decide if she had the wherewithal to inform the intent to kill.”
Hermosillo made a brief court appearance Wednesday, but her arraignment was postponed until Sept. 16.
Orange County Superior Court Judge Joe Perez set bail at $1 million, but federal immigration officials have a no-bail hold to keep her in custody because she is in the U.S. illegally, said Jim Amormino, sheriff’s spokesman.
Hermosillo is also on the medical ward, where she is being kept in a cell by herself and wearing a protective gown so she can’t injure herself, he said.

The judge appointed a public defender for Hermosillo, but the attorney did not comment after the hearing.
Farrah Emami, spokeswoman for the Orange County district attorney’s office said prosecutors were not commenting further on the infant’s medical conditions, or a motive in the case.
“We’re not going to speculate at this point as to why she may have done it. I don’t think there will ever be a satisfactory answer as to why a mother would do something like this to her child,” she said.
Adams said a witness on the ground saw the baby falling just after 6 p.m. Monday and several people, including a doctor, called 911.
Surveillance video showed Hermosillo’s tan Chevrolet Blazer sport utility vehicle with an empty child seat leaving the parking structure a short time later, the sergeant said. The license plate was traced to Hermosillo’s home.
During the investigation, La Habra police notified detectives that Medina had reported his wife and their son missing, Adams said.
An Orange police officer driving past Children’s Hospital at 10:15 p.m. spotted the Blazer driving on a street about 100 yards from the crime scene and Hermosillo was at the wheel, Adams said.
Court records in Orange County indicate Hermosillo has no major criminal record but pleaded guilty to four traffic violations in La Habra in 2008, including driving without a valid license and having no proof of insurance.

Casey Anthony Reports for Probation in Florida
by phillhillusa



Casey Anthony reported for probation in Florida Wednesday, according to her lead defense counsel Jose Baez.
Anthony will serve probation “somewhere in the state  of Florida,” though the exact location of her probation office is being kept  secret over concerns for her safety.
“She reported,” Attorney Jose Baez told Fox News.  “She told the officer she understands the conditions of her probation and she  was told the date for her next appearance.”
Judge Belvin Perry ruled earlier in August that  Anthony had until Aug. 26 to return to Florida to serve 12 months’ probation for  a check-fraud conviction, upholding a sentence by Judge Stan Strickland.
By the conditions of her probation, Anthony can not  drink in excess, break any laws, and must report periodically at a time  determined by law and the officer. She is also forbidden from leaving the  jurisdiction without specific written permission.
Due to security concerns, Anthony has been granted a  waiver stating she will not have to obtain employment. Instead, she must attend  school, which “will be online,” according to Baez.
The 25-year-old pleaded not guilty to the  first-degree murder charge in a trial that made headlines globally, claiming a  babysitter kidnapped her toddler. After she was acquitted, she was released from  jail and dropped from public sight.

Michelle Obama spends 10 million Tax Dollars on Vodka and Vacations
by phillhillusa



The Obamas’ summer break in Martha’s Vineyard has already been branded a PR disaster after the couple arrived four hours apart on separate government jets.But according to new reports, this is the least of their extravagances.
White House sources today claimed that the First Lady has spent $10million of U.S. taxpayers’ money on vacations alone in the past year.
Branding her ‘disgusting’ and ‘a vacation junkie’, they say the 47-year-old mother-of-two has been indulging in five-star hotels, where she splashes out on expensive massages and alcohol.
The ‘top source’ told the National Enquirer: ‘It’s disgusting. Michelle is taking advantage of her privileged position while the most hardworking Americans can barely afford a week or two off work.
‘When it’s all added up, she’s spent more than $10million in taxpayers’ money on her vacations.’
The First Lady is believed to have taken 42 days of holiday in the past year, including a $375,000 break in Spain and a four-day ski trip to Vail,Colorado, where she spent $2,000 a night on a suite at the Sebastian hotel.
And the first family’s nine-day stay in Martha’s Vineyard is also proving costly, with rental of the Blue Heron Farm property alone costing an estimated $50,000 a week.

The source continued: ‘Michelle also enjoys drinking expensive booze during her trips. She favours martinis with top-shelf vodka and has a taste for rich sparking wines.
‘The vacations are totally Michelle’s idea. She’s like a junkie. She can’t schedule enough getaways, and she lives from one to the next – all the while sticking it to hardworking Americans.’
While the President and his wife do pay for some of their personal expenses
from their own pocket, the website whitehousedossier.com says that the amount paid by the couple is ‘dwarfed by the overall cost to the public’.
The magazine also reported that Mrs Obama, whose fashion choices are widely followed, had been going on ‘wild shopping sprees’, much to the distress of her husband, who, its sources reveal, is ‘absolutely furious’ at his wife’s ‘out-of-control spending’

The President has already come under fire this week over his decision to take a family vacation while millions of Americans are out of work and countless more are financially strapped.But the situation sparked further anger after he and his wife elected to fly separately to the Massachusetts retreat – despite travelling on the same day.
Mr Obama left the White House aboard Marine One on his way to Andrews Air Force base to hitch a lift aboard Air Force One – along with First Dog Bo.
After landing at Cape Cod Coast Guard Air Station, he then took a final helicopter to his holiday destination to complete the remarkable 500-mile journey.
His wife and daughters, who arrived just four hours earlier, were also travelling from Washington, but took a specially designed military aircraft.
They would also have had their own motorcade from the airport to the vacation residence.

US hit by 90 earthquakes on Tuesday
by phillhillusa



The earthquake felt across the east coast yesterday may have been a rare event – but there were 90 other shakes across the U.S. on the same day.
The biggest of those was a 5.3 in Colorado, but only a few of the 90 were felt by people and just 12 were above a magnitude of 3.0.
The 5.8 earthquake in Virginia that was felt in New York and Washington D.C. was so widespread because the tremors were shallow at between one and four miles deep.
Tuesday was a typical day for earthquakes in the U.S. in terms of numbers of tremors – but such a big earthquake on the east coast was very unusual.A small earthquake shook the San Francisco Bay area as well last night, striking at 11:36pm local time and centred six miles from Oakland.
‘It was a strange day,’ Rafael Abreu, of the U.S. Geological Survey, told the Los Angeles Times. ‘But Mother Nature teaches us something new every single day.’
The Virginia area was hit by its strongest quake since 1897, which resulted in buildings such as the Capitol and Pentagon being evacuated.
The quake’s severity was ‘highly unusual’, one Brown University professor said, although it was in an area known for smaller quakes and it spread because of accommodating terrain.
‘This is the largest earthquake by far that I am aware of occurring there in recent history,’ seismology professor Karen Fisher said.
The wide spread of the shockwaves was common for the east coast – which is largely due to the difference in the terrain, research seismologist Peggy Hellweg said in California.
‘(California’s) ground is all of this chopped-up stuff – like a pile of marbles,’ she said, which means that the waves from a quake don’t spread out that far.But in eastern America, ‘what you’ve got there is gorgeous bedrock (and) the waves propagate beautifully.’

In addition, there is a difference in plate tectonics because the west coast is over the boundary between the North American and the Pacific.
She said in the East, ‘There’s no driving engine in terms of the two plates sliding past each other – so that’s why it’s much more unusual.’
Small earthquakes have been happening in central Virginia since at least the 1770s, reported the U.S. Geological Survey.
Quakes in central and eastern parts of the U.S. are less frequent than those in the west but are normally felt over a larger region.
Earthquakes east of the Rocky Mountains can be felt over an area up to ten times larger than one of a similar strength in the west.
An earthquake of the 5.5 level can often be felt as far as 300 miles from where it happened and cause damaged up to 25 miles away.Quakes happen on faults within bedrock that are usually miles deep, reported the U.S. Geological Survey.
Bedrock beneath Virginia came together as continents collided to create a super-continent up to 500 million years ago.
This was what raised the Appalachian Mountains and the bedrock rifted apart to form northeastern America and Europe.
The nearest plate boundaries from the central Virginia seismic zone are in the centre of the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea.But few shakes in the seismic zone can be connected to named faults because many are deeply buried and undetected.
Therefore the best guide to earthquake hazards in this seismic zone is actually the earthquakes themselves.

Woman shackled during labor gets $200,000.
by phillhillusa



An illegal immigrant awarded $200,000 in damages after being shackled while pregnant, in labor and during postpartum recovery will ask a federal judge permission to legally remain in the U.S.
A judge on Thursday ruled in favour of Juana Villegas in a civil case filed against the joint government of Nashville and Davidson County, stemming from a 2008 arrest on a minor traffic violation. 
Her attorney, Elliott Ozment, said on Saturday he will file a motion for a specific visa granted to illegal immigrants deemed victims of crime.
If a judge certifies she is eligible for the rare U-visa, Mr Ozment said he will proceed to immigration officials to see if the special status will be granted to his client
Appearing on a Saturday evening CNN broadcast, Mr Ozment said the visa would allow Ms Villegas , a Mexican national, to live and work legally in the country for three years.

The status can be renewed for another three years after its expiration. 
During that period, Ms Villegas could adjust her status and become a legal citizen, Mr Ozment said.’We think the level of misconduct has risen to such a high level that she deserves a U-visa for what she suffered. She has been the victim of a terrible, terrible wrong,’ he said.A U-visa has been awarded by a federal judge only one time before.But it would not be Ms Villegas’ first legal success. 
The court ruled in April that the sheriff’s office violated herconstitutional rights by showing indifference to her medical needs.And on Thursday,a federal jury awarded her $200,000 in monetary damages for claims she was shackled by Davidson County Sheriff’s deputies during labour.Ms Villegas told the court that she feared she would not be able to deliver her baby with leg restraints.
A psychiatrist testified she suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder.
The suit initially targeted federal officials. That part of the case was dismissed. 
Davidson County Sheriff Daron Hall said the department plans to appeal the decision.

Baby was born with ‘clown-nose’
by phillhillusa



For two-year-old Connie Lloyd, there was nothing amusing about having a bright red ‘clown’s nose’. 
Born with a benign tumour that grew to cover her nose, she suffered cruel taunts and name-calling and was told the rare condition could not be cured.
But the shy little girl has a reason to smile at last after surgeons defied the odds and left her with a ‘nose like mom’s’.
Doctors had spotted a shadow on Connie’s nose at the 26-week scan but when she was born in September 2008, she appeared perfectly healthy.
Connie, from Slough, Berkshire, was just a day old when parents Zara Green and Tom Lloyd, both 24, noticed a raised red mark on her nose.Within a month, it had grown to one and half inches in diameter.Zara said: ‘When we saw her nose we were amazed. She looked like a different child but we knew it was our Connie.’Their GP referred them to a skin specialist at Great Ormond Street Hospital, who diagnosed the baby with haemangioma – a benign tumour.

Connie became only the eighth baby in the UK to try the drug Propranolol – used for heart conditions – to stop the growth becoming larger.
But her parents were told there was no cure and also warned she could even bleed to death if her nose was scratched or bruised. 
Her mother searched for anyone who could help and eventually located surgeon Dr Iain Hutchison who specialises in treating facial disfigurements.
He operated on Connie in March, working to remove the tumour and leaving her with just a small scar.Her mother said: ‘Before the operation, Connie was quite shy and when people made comments and pointed she would turn her head.
‘Even just going to the doctors’ surgery was awful for both of us. I would hide Connie in the car to avoid people making horrible comments.’By the time Connie was four weeks old, her nose was a perfect clown’s nose and not only was the birthmark growing externally, but internally too.

‘We were constantly worried. The doctors said if she cut or grazed it, she could bleed to death. There were treatments to stop it getting bigger but nothing to get rid of it.’
‘It was the longest few hours of my life when Connie was in the theatre. When she came out of the operation she said her nose was like her mum’s. 
‘Now she is doing really well, she has a big group of friends and we are so proud of her.’She added: ‘It’s nice not to have to deal with the cruel comments any more but, red nose or not, Connie has always been our perfect little girl.’

Texas students sent from classroom to courtroom
by phillhillusa



In a small courtroom north of Houston, a fourth-grader walked up to the bench with his mother. Too short to see the judge, he stood on a stool. He was dressed in a polo shirt and dark slacks on a sweltering summer morning.
“Guilty,” the boy’s mother heard him say.He had been part of a scuffle on a school bus.
In another generation, he might have received only a scolding from the principal or a period of detention. But an array of get-tough policies in U.S. schools in the past two decades has brought many students into contact with police and courts — part of a trend some experts call the criminalization of student discipline. 
Now, such practices are under scrutiny nationally. Federal officials want to limit punishments that push students from the classroom to courtroom, and a growing number of state and local leaders are raising similar concerns. 
In Texas, the specter of harsh discipline has been especially clear.Here, police issue tickets: Class C misdemeanor citations for offensive language, class disruption, schoolyard fights. Thousands of students land in court, with fines of up to $500. Students with outstanding tickets may be arrested after age 17.
Texas also stands out for opening up millions of student records to a landmark study of discipline, released in July. The study shows that 6 in 10 students were suspended or expelled at least once from seventh grade on. After their first suspension, they were nearly three times more likely to be involved in the juvenile justice system the next year, compared with students with no such disciplinary referrals. 
Citing the Texas research, federal officials announced last month an initiative to break what many call the “school-to-prison pipeline.” Suspensions, expulsions and arrests are used too often to enforce school order, officials said. 
“That is something that clearly has to stop,” U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said in Washington alongside Education Secretary Arne Duncan.
This month, Duncan recounted that in his old job as Chicago schools chief, he was stunned to learn that so many arrests occurred in schools. The first response to student misbehavior, he said, “can’t be to pick up the phone and call 911.”
The federal focus comes amid other change. In Colorado, a legislative task force is examining discipline practices including law enforcement referrals and school ticketing. Los Angeles police recently agreed to cut back on ticketing tardy students en route to school.
Connecticut officials have begun screening cases after students wound up in
court on violations such as for having soda, running in the hall and dressing improperly. “It’s not that we don’t think these things should be handled,” said William Carbone, the state’s executive director of court support services. “We just think they should be handled in the school rather than the court.”
Research shows that students who have been arrested or appeared in court are more likely to drop out of high school, said Gary Sweeten, an Arizona State University criminologist. Dropouts, in turn, are more likely than graduates to be incarcerated or unemployed.

King and Queen of Sweden thrown out of German restaurant.
by phillhillusa



A red-faced restaurant owner in southern Germany admitted Sunday she had turned away Sweden’s king and queen when they asked for a table after failing to recognise them.
Nadine Schellenberger of Zum Gueldenen Stern, a half-timbered inn and pub founded in the 16th century in the centre of the southwestern town of Ladenburg, said the royals stopped in while she was hosting a wedding party.
“I didn’t recognise them. I mean without crowns and sceptres… I am just not up on royal families and I don’t have time for glossy magazines,” she told AFP after the incident Thursday.”Whether you’re a street sweeper or queen — we just didn’t have a table or enough manpower in the kitchen at that time and our hands were tied.”
Nevertheless Schellenberger and her husband Michael plan to send a letter to King Carl XVI Gustaf and German-born Queen Silvia to apologise.
“We want to tell them that we are sorry we didn’t recognise them immediately and that we weren’t able to serve them but that we would be delighted to welcome them another time,” she said.
Press reports said the royal couple and their entourage managed to get a pizza on the market square.

Dog eats $10,000 worth of diamonds
by phillhillusa


Diamong Eater,Honey Bun 
A Georgia dog apparently has a taste for the finer things in life.
The pooch dined on a meal of $10,000 worth of diamonds.
Honey Bun often walks the counters at John Ross Jewelers.He’s not much of a guard dog, but he is great with customer relations.”He’s been loved,” said co-owner Chuck Roberts.
Customers sometimes hide treats in their purse for Honey Bun, but the Roberts’ recently learned this pampered pooch has more expensive taste.
It happened two weeks ago when a customer came in.
“A customer came in and I jumped up out of my chair and came out here to wait on him. And I left the chair where you could jump up on my chair and jump up on my desk,” said Roberts.
On the desk: four packs of loose diamonds, about a carat each to set in diamond earrings, pens, and dog treats.
When he returned, only three packs remained, and an empty pouch was lying on the floor.”Looked all over and there weren’t no diamonds, so immediately, I knew he’d eaten them,” said Roberts.
Since Honey Bun wasn’t talking, there was only one way to find out.
“She came down and took him across the street, and Steve ran X-rays,” said Roberts.
Carbon doesn’t show up on an x-ray, but two blank spots confirmed Honey Bun was a likely suspect.
It only took a day, and they found another surprise.
“The next afternoon, sure enough, the earring back and two diamonds were recovered. No panic,” said Roberts.
Honey Bun was guilty as charged, but this pooch was granted a reprieve.
“I haven’t scolded him to this day and won’t,” said Roberts. “It was my fault for leaving the chair there.”It’s taught Roberts a valuable lesson.
He’s now very cautious about where he leaves his desk chair, and they’re keeping a closer eye on Honey Bun, especially around the precious gems.
The diamonds were cleaned up and sent back to the supplier.
As for Honey Bun? He got a clean bill of health.

Hef’s Ex Crystal Harris Moves In Dr. Phil’s Son
by phillhillusa



 Crystal Harris, the former Playboy Playmate who backed out of marrying Hugh Hefner at the last minute, was getting comfortable Friday with a new Los Angeles roommate — Dr. Phil’s son Jordan McGraw.
But the pair’s relationship is strictly business — for now, at least.
Harris and McGraw, both in their 20s, have been working on the model’s debut album since she left Hefner heartbroken in June. The Arizona native has been staying at McGraw’s home on and off for months, TMZ reported Friday, citing sources.
Now, the pair has formalized the arrangement, and Harris has officially moved in to the Hollywood Hills pad.
The musicians said they are just friends, but neither would object if “something romantic unfolds,” according to sources.
Harris caused a publicity storm when she dumped the Playboy mogul five days before their intended nuptials, then accused him of having a low libido during an interview with radio shock jock Howard Stern. She later apologized for that remark.

How Kim Kardashian Got Discovered
by phillhillusa



Kim Kardashian is hitting headlines a little more than usual ahead of her waaaaaay over-hyped wedding to pro-basketball player Kris Humphries this weekend. 
But while the blogosphere and tabloids are nauseatingly obsessing over the 50 guests that were cut from the guest list (the horror!), what color the bridesmaids dresses will be (not green!), or how sad it is that she has to put her honeymoon on hold due to work commitments (if your wedding is paid for by multiple cheesy sponsors, you gotta fulfill those contractual obligations!), there is one outlet reminding us how the reality star – who has built a multi-million dollar empire in large part by appealing to the tween/teen demographic – got her Hollywood start.
Vivid Entertainment, the world’s leading adult film studio which distributed the infamous, unauthorized and quite X-rated movie “Kim K Superstar” back in 2007 (co-starring boyfriend rapper Ray J) has announced their own Kardashian-inspired wedding celebration this week: a competition for a “lucky” couple to have their own “Honeymoon video” produced by the company. 
“If viewers want some inspiration for how they might make their own tape, a good place to start would be to check out Kim and Ray J’s moves by watching a clip at Vivid.com,” said Steven Hirsch, founder/co-chairman of the studio. “‘Kim K Superstar’ has consistently been one of our best selling celebrity movies and we believe it has stimulated many romantic moments.”

Israeli Woman Makes Brave Escape From Homemade German Torture Chamber
by phillhillusa


n this photo taken Aug. 22, a telephone booth stands in an apartment in Hamburg, Germany. The suspect forced the woman to go to his mezzanine apartment at gunpoint last Friday evening, according to police. Police have discovered a telephone booth, a homemade hand grenade and dozens of fire extinguishers in the apartment in their investigation of a suspected kidnapping.
HAMBURG, Germany –  German police were investigating Wednesday after a woman was apparently kidnapped in the northern city of Hamburg and kept captive in a homemade torture chamber.
The Israeli woman made a brave escape from the soundproofed cell, made from a converted telephone booth, in 30-year-old Thomas Fischer’s ground floor apartment — fleeing when her captor forgot to lock the door and diving to freedom through a barbed wire-covered window.
The unnamed 26-year-old, an acquaintance of Fischer, was abducted at gunpoint Friday night from her home in Barmbek, a suburb of Hamburg — 158 miles (255km) northwest of Berlin — according to newspaper Hamburger Morgenpost.
In this photo taken Aug. 22, police remove barbed wire from an apartment window in Hamburg. Germany. Officers were still on the scene on Aug. 24, five days after an alleged victim escaped the apartment.
Police fear Fisher was preparing for an extended stay with his victim, stocking his home with enough supplies to last him several months. But the woman said she fled to safety after just two-and-a-half hours, when he forgot to lock the chamber.
He is reported to have given chase, armed, but was unable to catch the woman, who ran to a friend’s house where she alerted police.
n this photo taken Aug. 22, police remove barbed wire from an apartment window in Hamburg. Germany. Officers were still on the scene on Aug. 24, five days after an alleged victim escaped the apartment.
When officers stormed Fisher’s heavily fortified apartment, they allegedly found a pistol, a hand grenade and surgical equipment including a scalpel, syringes and gynecological tools with which he had experimented on a mannequin.
He had also stockpiled 113 fire extinguishers, some of which contained traces of explosives. In his bedroom were timber beams that police believe he had planned to use to board up the windows and doors.
Hamburger Morgenpost also reported that Fisher had been investigated previously for assault and stalking. He has not spoken since his arrest, according to reports, and no charges have been released.
A police spokesman was quoted as saying, “The whole two-roomed apartment was rigged up as one massive torture chamber, with this big old-fashioned telephone kiosk soundproofed as the cell for his victim.”
The police prosecutor said, “It is evident that the apartment was meant as a place of confinement for some time.”
Bild reported that police had begun searching for an accomplice who may have helped Fisher move the 276-pound (125kg), eight-foot-tall (2.3-metre-tall) phone booth and timber beams into his flat.
The case has drawn comparisons with that of Austrian woman Natascha Kampusch, who was held for more than eight years in a basement cell by Wolfgang Priklopil between 1998 and 2006.
