South Korean Cargo Ship Hijacked by Somali Pirates  Order: Reorder Duration: 1:24 Published: 17 Jan 2011 Uploaded: 06 Jul 2011 Author: NTDTV  For more news visit ☛english.ntdtv.com Another South Korean ship has been hijacked by Somali pirates over the weekend. South Korea's Foreign Ministry says it is seeking to secure the ship's release. On Monday South Korea's foreign ministry said that it will try to win the release of the cargo ship "Samho Jewelry" that was hijacked by Somali pirates over the weekend. [Kim Young-sun, Foreign Ministry Spokesman] "Our government will consider all possible measures to solve the hijacking case as soon as possible. And we will cooperate closely with the international community to stop such activities by pirates in the future." Somali pirates commandeered the ship which belongs to Samho Shipping in the Arabian Sea, on Saturday. Two months ago a super oil tanker belonging to the same company was freed after being held hostage for seven months. Somali pirates say they got a record sum of $9.5 million ransom for the supertanker. The "Samho Jewelry" has a crew of eight Koreans, two Indonesians and 11 from Burma. It was hijacked while on its way to Sri Lanka from the United Arab Emirates. A South Korean Navy destroyer was about 1200 miles away at the time. Over the last few years, pirates have seized dozens of ships, including large oil tankers, in the Indian Ocean and Gulf of Aden. South Korean media reports the crew are safe, but the exact location of the ship is not known. Officials at Samho Shipping have not been reachable for comment.

Instead he was surrounded by three armed Mexican soldiers in ski masks and camouflage as he told reporters that he helped a Mexican drug gang behead four people. Mexican officials say they arrested the youth known as "El Ponchis" late Thursday at an airport south of Mexico City with a 19-year-old sister who is accused of helping him dump the bodies. Authorities said he was caught with two cell phones that held photographs of tortured victims. Many youths have been used by drug cartels in their bloody battles against the government and each other, but the story of El Ponchis may be the most shocking. A YouTube video that emerged a month ago sparked talk of a child hit man — said by some to be as young as 12. "I participated in four executions, but I did it drugged and under threat that if I didn't, they would kill me," the boy said calmly when he was handed over to the federal prosecutor Friday morning, showing no remorse. Authorities identified the curly-haired suspect by his first name only — Edgar. He told reporters early Friday he was kidnapped at the age of 11 and forced to work for the Cartel of the South Pacific, a branch of the splintered Beltran Leyva gang, and that he had participated in at least four decapitations.

In modern times, containers are used in most intermodal long-haul cargo transport.  Transportation types Marine  There is a wide range of marine cargo handled at seaport terminals.   Automobiles are handled at many ports and are usually carried on specialized roll-on/roll-off ships.  Break bulk cargo is typically material stacked on pallets and lifted into and out of the hold of a vessel by cranes on the dock or aboard the ship itself. The volume of break bulk cargo has declined dramatically worldwide as containerization has grown. A safe and secure way to secure break bulk and freight in containers is by using Dunnage Bags.  Bulk cargo, such as salt, oil, tallow, and scrap metal, is usually defined as commodities that are neither on pallets nor in containers. Bulk cargoes are not handled as individual pieces, the way heavy-lift and project cargoes are. Alumina, grain, gypsum, logs and wood chips, for instance, are bulk cargoes.  Containers are the largest and fastest growing cargo category at most ports worldwide. Containerized cargo includes everything from auto parts, machinery and manufacturing components to shoes and toys to frozen meat and seafood.  Project cargo and the heavy lift cargo include items like manufacturing equipment, air conditioners, factory components, generators, wind turbines, military equipment, and almost any other oversized or overweight cargo which is too big or too heavy to fit into a container.  Air  Boeing 747-400F with the nose loading door open]]  Air cargo, commonly known as air freight, is collected by firms from shippers and delivered to customers. Aircraft were first used for carrying mail as cargo in 1911. Eventually manufacturers started designing aircraft for other types of freight as well.   There are many commercial aircraft suitable for carrying cargo such as the Boeing 747 and the bigger An-124, which was purposely built for easy conversion into a cargo aircraft. Such large aircraft employ quick-loading containers known as Unit Load Devices (ULDs), much like containerized cargo ships. The ULDs are located in front section of the aircraft.   Most nations own and utilize large numbers of cargo aircraft such as the C-17 Globemaster III for airlift logistic needs.   Train   inter-modal freight well car at Banbury station in the year 2001]] Trains are capable of transporting large numbers of containers that come from shipping ports. Trains are also used for the transportation of steel, wood and coal. They are used because they can carry a large amount and generally have a direct route to the destination. Under the right circumstances, freight transport by rail is more economic and energy efficient than by road, especially when carried in bulk or over long distances.   The main disadvantage of rail freight is its lack of flexibility. For this reason, rail has lost much of the freight business to road transport. Rail freight is often subject to transshipment costs, since it must be transferred from one mode of transportation to another. Practices such as containerization aim at minimizing these costs.   Many governments are currently trying to encourage shippers to use trains more often because of the environmental benefits.   Road Many firms, like Parcelforce, FedEx, and u-haul transport all types of cargo by road. Delivering everything from letters to houses to cargo containers, these firms offer fast, sometimes same-day, delivery.   A good example of road cargo is food, as supermarkets require deliveries every day to keep their shelves stocked with goods. Retailers of all kinds rely upon delivery trucks, be they full size semi trucks or smaller delivery vans.   Shipment categories Freight is usually organized into various shipment categories before it is transported. An item's category is determined by: the type of item being carried. For example, a kettle could fit into the category 'household goods'.  how large the shipment is, in terms of both item size and quantity. how long the item for delivery will be in transit.  Shipments are typically categorized as household goods, express, parcel, and freight shipments:   Household goods (HHG) include furniture, art and similar items.  Very small business or personal items like envelopes are considered overnight express or express letter shipments. These shipments are rarely over a few kilograms or pounds and almost always travel in the carrier’s own packaging. Express shipments almost always travel some distance by air. An envelope may go coast to coast in the United States overnight or it may take several days, depending on the service options and prices chosen by the shipper.  Larger items like small boxes are considered parcels or ground shipments. These shipments are rarely over , with no single piece of the shipment weighing more than about . Parcel shipments are always boxed, sometimes in the shipper’s packaging and sometimes in carrier-provided packaging. Service levels are again variable but most ground shipments will move about  per day. Depending on the origin of the package, it can travel from coast to coast in the United States in about four days. Parcel shipments rarely travel by air and typically move via road and rail. Parcels represent the majority of business-to-consumer (B2C) shipments.   Beyond HHG, express, and parcel shipments, movements are termed freight shipments.  Less-than-truckload freight Less than truckload (LTL) cargo is the first category of freight shipment, which represents the majority of freight shipments and the majority of business-to-business (B2B) shipments. LTL shipments are also often referred to as motor freight and the carriers involved are referred to as motor carriers.   LTL shipments range from , being less than  the majority of times. The average single piece of LTL freight is  and the size of a standard pallet. Long freight and/or large freight are subject to extreme length and cubic capacity surcharges.   Trailers used in LTL can range from . The standard for city deliveries is usually . In tight and residential environments the  trailer is used the most.   The shipments are usually palletized, shrink-wrapped and packaged for a mixed-freight environment. Unlike express or parcel, LTL shippers must provide their own packaging, as carriers do not provide any packaging supplies or assistance. However, circumstances may require crating or other substantial packaging.   Air freight Air freight shipments are very similar to LTL shipments in terms of size and packaging requirements. However, air freight or air cargo shipments typically need to move at much faster speeds than  per day. Air shipments may be booked directly with the carriers, through brokers or with online marketplace services. While shipments move faster than standard LTL, air shipments don’t always actually move by air.   Truckload freight In the United States, shipments larger than about  are typically classified as truckload (TL) freight. This is because it is more efficient and economical for a large shipment to have exclusive use of one larger trailer rather than share space on a smaller LTL trailer.   The total weight of a loaded truck (tractor and trailer, 5-axle rig) cannot exceed  in the United States{fact}. In ordinary circumstances, long-haul equipment will weigh about , leaving about  of freight capacity. Similarly a load is limited to the space available in the trailer, normally  or  long,  wide,  high and  high over all.   While express, parcel and LTL shipments are always intermingled with other shipments on a single piece of equipment and are typically reloaded across multiple pieces of equipment during their transport, TL shipments usually travel as the only shipment on a trailer. In fact, TL shipments usually deliver on exactly the same trailer as they are picked up on.   Shipping costs Often, an LTL shipper may realize savings by utilizing a freight broker, online marketplace or other intermediary, instead of contracting directly with a trucking company. Brokers can shop the marketplace and obtain lower rates than most smaller shippers can obtain directly. In the LTL marketplace, intermediaries typically receive 50% to 80% discounts from published rates, where a small shipper may only be offered a 5% to 30% discount by the carrier. Intermediaries are licensed by the DOT and have requirements to provide proof of insurance.   Truckload (TL) carriers usually charge a rate per kilometre or mile. The rate varies depending on the distance, geographic location of the delivery, items being shipped, equipment type required, and service times required. TL shipments usually receive a variety of surcharges very similar to those described for LTL shipments above. In the TL market, there are thousands more small carriers than in the LTL market. Therefore, the use of transportation intermediaries or brokers is extremely common.   Another cost-saving method is facilitating pickups or deliveries at the carrier’s terminals. By doing this, shippers avoid any accessorial fees that might normally be charged for liftgate, residential pickup/delivery, inside pickup/delivery, or notifications/appointments. Carriers or intermediaries can provide shippers with the address and phone number for the closest shipping terminal to the origin and/or destination.   Shipping experts optimize their service and costs by sampling rates from several carriers, brokers and online marketplaces. When obtaining rates from different providers, shippers may find quite a wide range in the pricing offered. If a shipper uses a broker, freight forwarder or other transportation intermediary, it is common for the shipper to receive a copy of the carrier's Federal Operating Authority. Freight brokers and intermediaries are also required by Federal Law to be licensed by the Federal Highway Administration. Experienced shippers avoid unlicensed brokers and forwarders because if brokers are working outside the law by not having a Federal Operating License, the shipper has no protection in the event of a problem. Also, shippers normally ask for a copy of the broker's insurance certificate and any specific insurance that applies to the shipment.   Security concerns Governments are very concerned with the shipment of cargo, as it may bring security risks to a country. Therefore, many governments have enacted rules and regulations, administered by a customs agency, to the handling of cargo to minimize risks of terrorism and other crime. Of particular concern is cargo entering through a country's borders.   The United States has been one of the leaders in securing cargo. They see cargo as a concern to national security. After the terrorist attacks of September 11th, the security of this magnitude of cargo has become highlighted on the over 6 million cargo containers enter the United States ports each year. The latest US Government response to this threat is the CSI: Container Security Initiative. CSI is a program intended to help increase security for containerized cargo shipped to the United States from around the world.   Stabilization  There are many different ways and materials available to stabilize and secure cargo in the various modes of transportation. Conventional load securing methods and materials such as steel strapping and wood blocking & bracing have been used for decades and are still widely used. Present load securing methods offer several other options including polyester strapping and lashing, synthetic webbings and dunnage bags, also known as air bags or inflatable bags.
