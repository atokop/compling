@Mr777truth777 America is such a paradise for queers that the queers get beat up by idiots like you on a regular basis. Dumbfucks like you want to prevent liberal fascists from taking away your constitutional right to beat up homosexuals.

@honestlyimbatman Irregular areas? During the last ice age the eastern part of America was covered in 2 miles of ice. This caused the continental plate to shift downwards into the mantle. The pressure within the earth is causing the landmass in the area to rebound upwards. This is well understood and is what caused the 1811 quake. It has nothing to do with gay people. You can nuke the entire planet and make the human species go extinct and this will still happen. It’s physics.

@TheStreeser1 Americans aren’t shit either. Americans suck, which means America’s chosen leaders suck, which makes the country suck..You cannot logically separate Americans from America. People try to do it all the time, but it mostly makes no sense at all.

May be it’s the shock wave as the US politicians are having a party and jumping all over the congress, with deep and heavy pockets after grabbing the oil in Libya. Expect big tremors when they try to mass murder Syrians and Iranians.

The Alex Jones fucktards, you know, the same people who post those lists of JEWS on every RT video, will blame this on HAARP, a radio transmitter in Alaska that has supposedly caused earthquakes in Japan, Haiti and Chile. The religious fucktards will blame this on queers. Sane, rational people will study plate tectonics. This earthquake is probably caused by a rebounding of earth due to former glaciation.

Hahahha the Haarp posts always make me laugh.
People forget the history of earthquakes, and now any earthquake that occurs henceforth must be HAARP.

The reason for this earthquake is probably due to rebounding of the earth’s crust due to the fact it was covered with 2 miles of ice 10,000 years ago. It has absolutely nothing to do with HAARP, which simply sends radio waves through the northern hemisphere, and yet has been blamed for every single earthquake, hurricane, tornado and tsunami since its inception.

@honestlyimbatman and this natural disaster was probably due to a rebounding of the earth after being covered in 2 miles of ice during the last ice age. Earthquakes happen due to plate tectonics and resistance between areas of the earth’s crust. When the resistance between these segments reaches a critical point they snap and move away from each other, triggering an earthquake. Maybe homosexual dinosaurs created earthquakes millions of years ago.
