						By  Associated Press, 







RICHMOND, Va. — The 5.8-magnitude earthquake that rattled the East Coast on Aug. 23 continues to produce aftershocks.
At least 18 aftershocks ranging in magnitude from 4.5 to as little as 2.0 followed the strongest earthquake to strike the East Coast since World War II, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Two of the latest happened late Monday night.

Aftershocks, smaller tremors that take place in the weeks and possibly months following a major earthquake like the one centered in Mineral, Va., are usually felt in a smaller area than the original quake.The largest of the aftershocks so far — a 4.5-magnitude quake last Thursday — was felt by people in nearly 1,100 zip codes from New England to the north, Georgia to the south, and Illinois to the west, according to the USGS. Tens of millions of people from Georgia to Canada were jolted by the initial tremor.___Michael Felberbaum can be reached at http://www.twitter.com/MLFelberbaum.___Online:U.S. Geological Survey: http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/Copyright 2011 The Associated Press.
