A rare 5.9-magnitude earthquake has struck the east coast of United States, shaking some of the country's largest cities. The US geological survey said the quake occurred in central Virginia, about 165km south of the capital, Washington DC, and was the most severe quake in the area in more than a century. In Washington DC, the White House, the Pentagon and the US Capitol were all evacuated. The tremor has affected flights, trains and phone services across the US, while a nuclear reactor was shut down. Officials are now assessing the damage to property.

The US Geological Survey said the earthquake was half a mile deep. Shaking was felt at the White House and all over the East Coast, as far south as Chapel Hill, NC Parts of the Pentagon, White House and Capitol were evacuated. There were no immediate reports of injuries. The Pentagon was later deemed safe for reoccupation. A 5.9 magnitude earthquake centered northwest of Richmond, Va., shook much of Washington, DC, and was felt as far north as Rhode Island, New York City and Martha's Vineyard, Mass. The East Coast gets earthquakes, but usually smaller ones and is less prepared than California or Alaska for shaking.

A new report released today in the Kremlin prepared for Prime Minister Putin by the Institute of Physics of the Earth, in Moscow, is warning that the America's are in danger of suffering a mega-quake of catastrophic proportions during the next fortnight (14 days) with a specific emphasis being placed on the United States, Mexico, Central America and South American west coast regions along with the New Madrid Fault Zone region. This report further warns that catastrophic earthquakes in Asia and the sub-continent are, also, "more than likely to occur" with the 7.3 magnitude quake in Japan today being "one of at least 4 of this intensity" to occur during this same time period. Raising the concerns of a mega-quake occurring, this report says, are the increasing subtle electromagnetic signals that are being detected in the Earth's upper atmosphere over many regions of the World, with the most intense being over the US Western coastal and Midwest regions. Important to note are that Russian and British scientists are at the forefront of predicting earthquakes based on these subtle electromagnetic signals and have joined in an effort to put satellites in space to detect more of them. More ominously in this report are Russian scientists confirming the independent analysis of New Zealand mathematician and long-range weather forecaster, Ken Ring, who predicted the deadly Christchurch quake and this week issued another warning of a quake to hit on or about March 20th.

As far north as the Cascadia range in the Pacific Northwest, south east to yellowstone, then further south east to georgia, up north to Montreal / New York ... The threat of a new madrid earthquake , in my opinion, goes up ANOTHER notch, with the signs of more activity in the north east, extending along the faults down to Arkansas. The pressure buildup is extending across the atlantic to the mid-Atlantic ridge, and now showing signs of stress on BOTH sides of the european plate.. the european plate is showing signs of "uptick" in activity.. as far north as south belgium, east towards Poland and south to the mediterranean sea. Expect anywhere along a plate boundry and anwhere there are active volcanos to experience 5.0 quakes and greater for the next 2 weeks or more. Also areas where DORMANT volcanos exist .. such as greenbrier Arkansas, Mono Lake California, off the coast of seattle, south belgium / west germany...

Studies of Glacial rebound give us information about the flow law of mantle rocks and also past ice sheet history. The former is important to the study of Mantle Convection, Plate Tectonics and the thermal evolution of the Earth. The latter is important to the study of Glaciology, Paleoclimate and changes in Global Sea Level. Understanding postglacial rebound is also important to our ability to monitor recent global change. To form the ice sheets of the last Ice Age, water is taken from the oceans through evaporation, condensation as snow and then deposited as ice in high latitudes. Thus global sea level would fall during glaciation. The ice sheets at the last Glacial Maximum were so massive that global sea level fell by about 120 metres. Thus continental shelves were exposed and many islands became connected with the continents through dry land. This was the case between the British Isles and Europe, or between Taiwan <b>...</b>

SUMMARY This film shows the aftermath of the San Francisco earthquake of April 18, 1906, and the devastation resulting from the subsequent three-day fire. The 8.3 magnitude earthquake struck at 5:12am and was centered along the San Andreas Fault, which slices through coastal California. Most of the cities of central California were badly damaged. San Francisco, with thousands of unreinforced brick buildings - and thousands more closely-spaced wooden Victorian dwellings - was poorly prepared for a major fire. Collapsed buildings, broken chimneys, and a shortage of water due to broken mains led to several large fires that soon coalesced into a city-wide holocaust. The fire swept over nearly a quarter of the city, including the entire downtown area. Dynamite was used with varying success to prevent the fire from spreading westward. Over 3000 people are now estimated to have died as a result of the disaster. For the surviving refugees, the first few weeks were hard; as aid poured in from around the country, thousands slept in tents in city parks, and all citizens were asked to do their cooking in the street. A severe shortage of public transportation made a taxicab out of anything on wheels. Numerous businesses relocated teporarily in Oakland and many refugees found lodgings outside the city. Reconstruction of the city proceeded at a furious pace and by 1908, San Francisco was well on the way to recovery. The scenes in the film are preceded by titles, many of which are <b>...</b>

Chile Earthquake - Magnitude 8.8 Earthquake Shook Chile - A massive earthquake shook central Chile on Saturday with an initial magnitude of 8.8. The quake struck at 0634 GMT about 91km (56 miles) north-east of the city of Concepcion and 317km south-west of the capital, Santiago. Outgoing President Michelle Bachelet said that she had reports of six deaths so far and could not rule out that there might be more. The US issued an initial tsunami warning for Chile, Peru and Ecuador. That was later extended to Colombia, Antarctica, Panama and Costa Rica. Japans meteorological agency has warned of a potential tsunami across large areas of the Pacific. Aftershock President Bachelet called on people to remain calm and contact the authorities if they needed help. She said: The country has just experienced an enormous earthquake we are in the process of finding out about the effects of the quake across the region, the state of the roads and hospitals, the damage to buildings and of course the number of those killed and injured. Ms Bachelet, who has now gone into an emergency meeting, said that there were areas of the country where communications were down and teams were working to restore them. Buildings in Santiago were reported to have shaken for between 10 and 30 seconds, with the loss of electricity and communications. The US Geological Survey (USGS) said the earthquake struck at a depth of about 35km. It recorded a 6.2 magnitude aftershock in the same area soon after at 0652 <b>...</b>

As Hercolubus approaches us the Earth axis shift progressively. The Earth's axis has already shifted from its position and through tremors, earthquakes, tsunamis and tidal waves it will become completely loose and then sink current lands. The planet will not sink suddenly. This will be a long, slow, distressing and painful process, through which Humanity will have to go. It will sink piece by piece into the ocean until it reaches its end. A sample was the Friday's earthquake caused by the Hercolubus approaching, that struck Japan, and it was so powerful that it actually moved the whole planet by 25 cm. According to Italy's National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology the 8.9 magnitude 'quake was so powerful it shifted the axis around which the Earth rotates. The shift to the Earth's tilt will have profound, if subtle effects on the length of the day and the passage of the seasons. The speed of the planet's rotation will change as the globe's mass has been redistributed. The epicenter of the earthquake was 373 km northeast of Tokyo and 130 km east of Sendai, according to the US Geological Survey. Dr Daniel McNamara, a seismologist with the US Geological Survey reported that the main island of Japan has been shifted 2.4 meters and opened up gigantic ruptures in the sea floor. He also warned that tremors had also sunk the elevation of the country's terrain, leaving parts permanently below sea-level. 'You see cities still underwater; the reason is subsidence,' he said <b>...</b>

Now the two busiest container ports in the United States are seeing the effects of the disaster on Japanese imports.
