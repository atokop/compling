The storm had previously hit Taiwan and the Philippines. Let's take a look. "Heavy rainfall brought by Nanmadol wreaked havoc in Fuzhou, Putian and Ningde, saturating the earth and it could very likely cause geological disasters." In Fujian province, shipping was suspended and fishing boats called back to port. In Zhejiang province, heavy rainfall triggered flooding in the mountains, damaging houses, and causing 15 reservoirs to overflow. More than 100 people have had to be rescued from floodwaters. Nanmadol is also expected to trigger rainfall in nearby provinces of Anhui, Zhejiang and Jiangxi on Wednesday.

Days after withstanding a rare earthquake, large swaths of the densely populated US East Coast have weathered Irene, a once-powerful hurricane later downgraded to a tropical storm. Irene drenched New York Sunday after coming ashore over coastal areas farther south. At least 18 deaths are blamed on the storm, which prompted a massive mobilization of federal, state and local governments.

We may retain other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Such third parties may be provided with access to personally identifiable information needed to perform their functions, but may not use such information for any other purpose.
