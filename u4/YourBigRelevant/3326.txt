The Curious Case of Marine One's Emergency Landing



On Friday, Marine One -- the President's helicopter -- was forced to land on its way to Camp David due to inclement weather that no one else could see: • President Obama and his oldest daughter Sasha landed in an undisclosed location and were quickly transferred to a motorcade to complete their trip... • The same day, a civilian aircraft was intercepted close to Camp David and is escorted to an airfield in West Virginia by a pair of F-15s... • Also that day, the FBI issued a nationwide warning about Al Qaeda threats to small aircraft, only days before the tenth anniversary of 9/11...Law enforcement received a five-page bulletin from DHS that outlined a general -- but not yet specific -- threat: The alert, issued ahead of the summer’s last busy travel weekend, said terrorists have considered renting private planes and loading them with explosives.“Al-Qaida and its affiliates have maintained an interest in obtaining aviation training, particularly on small aircraft, and in recruiting Western individuals for training in Europe or the United States, although we do not have current, credible information or intelligence of an imminent attack being planned,” according to the bulletin obtained by The Associated Press.The bulletin also says al-Qaida would like to use sympathetic Westerners to get flight training, then get them to become flight instructors.You can't blame the Secret Service for taking any and all precautions to protect the president.  And certainly they need to remain mum about their tactics.  But the questions remain:In a highly unusual maneuver, President Obama’s 30-minute flight to the Presidential mountain retreat at Camp David Friday afternoon was diverted to an undisclosed landing near Frederick, Md. and a motorcade assembled to drive him to the nearby site. White House press secretary Jay Carney tells ABC News a “bad weather call” was made before the President and his younger daughter Sasha even boarded the aircraft.Carney says they arrived safely at Camp David. It remains unexplained why the President would be allowed to board Marine One knowing that the landing site on the mountain was experiencing poor weather making a landing difficult....At the time Marine One took off in Washington Accuweather.com reported there was no precipitation across the entire region, including Camp David... Light winds blew from the southeast at 10mph with mostly cloudy skies and temperatures in the mid-70s.Bottom line: better safe than sorry.Labels: Obama, Protecting America

Another Coincidence



Lifted from Cliffs of Insanity*:I'm sure that the timing of all this is just coincidence.  The big flashmobs in Britain this summerThe flashrobsThe flashriots in Wisconsin and "urban" rallies elsewhereIt's Over in the Eurozone.  You know, when a 9.0 earthquake hits, a tsunami often follows.  Zero private sector jobs added last monthPres__ent Obama waiting to give his "jobs" speech (as if another layer of Simoniz can help the turd to shine better)And Jimmy Hoffa offering up his "Army", ready to march and "take these son of bitches out."  Updated: Project Gunwalker And now Project Gangwalker - walking guns to criminal gangs inside the US.  Why . . . it's like it's all building up to something.  I'm reminded of the words from The Road Warrior: When it's all said and done, The Road Warrior may look like a happy, sunny memory compared to what we're about to go through.Their leaders talked and talked and talked but nothing could stem the avalanche. Their world crumbled the cities exploded. A whirlwind of looting, a firestorm of fear.*Hopefully any lawsuit by Cliffs of Insanity will be preempted by global Armageddon.Hat tip: D&S.Labels: Crime, Democrats, Economy, Firearms, Obama, Unions

Hoffa Declares All-Out 'War' on GOP: 'Take These Son Of Bitches Out'



Self-proclaimed Marxist Dick Trumka Jimmy Hoffa, Jr., president of the AFL-CIO Teamsters, had some uncivil, inflammatory words for Republicans today in the lead up to President Barack Obama's remarks in Detroit.Teamsters President Jimmy Hoffa had some profane, combative words for Republicans while warming up the crowd for President Obama in Detroit, Michigan on Monday."We got to keep an eye on the battle that we face: The war on workers. And you see it everywhere, it is the Tea Party. And you know, there is only one way to beat and win that war. The one thing about working people is we like a good fight. And you know what? They've got a war, they got a war with us and there's only going to be one winner. It's going to be the workers of Michigan, and America. We're going to win that war," Jimmy Hoffa Jr. said to a heavily union crowd."President Obama, this is your army. We are ready to march. Let's take these son of bitches out and give America back to an America where we belong," Hoffa added... Obama addressed the crowd shortly after Hoffa.I believe that the Democrat Party, now controlled by the hard left, sixties retreads and funded by one-world-government Statists like George Soros, are actively preparing to foment civil unrest in the run-up to the 2012 elections.In recent days, the execrable columnist Leonard Pitts, the ethically challenged Rep. Maxine Waters, the nonsensical Rep. Frederica Wilson, the rhyming adulterer "Reverend" Jesse Jackson and a host of other far left kooks have echoed the same "Big Lie" as if reading off some invisible teleprompter.Their outrageous "Big Lie"?  That a disconnected, decentralized group of millions of law-abiding citizens -- people of every race, religion, creed and color... people who believe in Constitutional, limited, financially responsible government... people who gather peacefully in cities and towns across the United States! -- are somehow malevolent because of the mere fact that they dare to speak up.Even more violent rhetoric was echoed by a left-wing Islamist race-baiter named Andre Carson:REP. ANDRE CARSON, (D), INDIANA: Some of these folks in Congress right now would love to see us as second-class citizens. (audience members reply, "Yes!") Some of them in Congress right now of this Tea Party would love to see you and me- I'm sorry, Tamron- hanging on a tree. (audience members reply, "Yes!") Some of them right now in Congress are comfortable with where we were 50 and 60 years ago.One can come to no other conclusion that the Democrat Party is actively encouraging violence.We certainly don't hear much about civility and Gabbi Giffords from legacy media these days.Because, in truth, the only people promoting intimidation, violence and thuggish behavior are the radical Leftist goons controlling the Democrat Party.This behavior is disturbing and sickening.  And legacy media better stand up and call it out, before it's too late.Update: Moments after Trumka Hoffa declared "war" on Republicans and vowed to the "take the sons-of-bitches out", President Obama stated how "proud" he was of the AFL-CIO Teamsters chief.Update II: Correction made, thanks to TAB: this was Hoffa, not Trumka.  All these labor leaders look alike to me.Labels: Crime, Democrats, extremism, Obama, Unions

John Mauldin on Gold



John Mauldin, author and financial advisor, has some interesting thoughts on gold.
 The question I am asked the most is some variant on “What do you think about gold?” So, let me deal with that question here, as it has been a while.
 First, I do not think of gold as an investment. It is insurance for me. I buy a rather fixed amount of gold nearly every month, no matter the price. I hope the price of gold goes down, because that means I get more coins in the mail to go into the vault. Yes, I take delivery of my gold, and it is near me if I need it.
 My fondest dream is that I will give my gold coins to my great-great grandkids some 70-80 years from now, and they will be rather embarrassed that their “Papa John” bought all that much of that barbarous yellow metal instead of more biotech stocks. But as I live in the real world, I buy gold, even though I am optimistic we’ll get through this rough patch; because I simply don’t trust the bas*%*ds who are driving this ship with 100% of my money in dollars, or any fiat currency, for that matter.
 Gold to me is a neutral currency. While the metal looks good over the last ten years (and I became bullish on it in 2002 in this letter), over the last 32 years it has not had all that much luster. Bonds have been much better as an investment. It is all about timing.
 If I wanted to buy gold for investment or trading, I would simply buy GLD. (It is an excellent vehicle for traders; however, GLD is not what I think of as insurance.) And if I were buying gold as a trade, I would buy it in terms of the euro or yen, which I think are both going down against the US dollar.
 For those who want to buy larger sums of gold, there is a program that I like backed/sponsored by the state government of Western Australia, called the Perth Mint. You can buy gold certificates that represent actual bullion in vaults in Perth at reasonable prices. While your gold is stored in Perth, you can take delivery if you want and leave the country with no taxes owed. Or you can sell the gold and get cash. You diversify your country risk, have excellent and safe storage facilities, diversify your currency risk (if, like me, you think of gold as a currency), and have a different asset class than traditional portfolios.
 ...Where to buy actual bullion? Gold coins are gold coins. ASI is a good choice, but I would shop around. Depending on the amount you are buying, mark-ups can be significant, and there are differences in service and responsiveness. Delivery can be an issue, although I get mine in the mail with insured mail (although we do have to pick it up!).
 Do I think gold is at a high? While I hope so, I truly do, I rather think that gold still has some upside because of government policies. When the deficit gets under control and we are on the road to real recovery, I rather think that gold will come back down from whatever highs it makes. I remember in 1980 there were True Believers who thought gold could only go one way.
 For the record, I think you should own about 5% of your net worth in gold, as insurance, not as an investment. The “goal” and your hope should be to never have a reason to sell your gold. I trust that tells you where I stand. Given the ongoing meltdown in Europe -- with a liquidity crunch unfolding at this very moment -- words of caution are warranted.
 Banks are seeking to retain their liquidity, making interbank lending more difficult, as funding from money and capital markets becomes harder to obtain, ABN Amro Group NV Chief Executive Officer Gerrit Zalm said.
 Interbank borrowing for more than six months is also becoming problematic because banks are reluctant to lend to competitors with “big positions in weaker countries’ debt, for instance,” he said today on Dutch television...
 A demise of the euro would have “catastrophic” consequences for the Dutch economy, which sends about three- fourths of its exports to other euro-zone states, and “would cause a recession that would make the 1930s a trifle by comparison,” Zalm said. No one can say where the price of gold is headed.  But the reckless debts run up by big government Marxists and progressives around the world do nothing but demoralize investors in fiat currencies.

Gibson Guitar's Official Statement on its Persecution by the Government



Gibson CEO Juszkiewicz says, "...perhaps our good friends in the media can use their investigative skills to help us to get the bottom of exactly why the government has singled out Gibson for harassment."
 The Justice department bullies Gibson without filing charges FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 Gov’t says wood is illegal if U.S. workers produce it Thursday, August 25, 2011  The Federal Department of Justice in Washington, D.C. has suggested that the use of wood from India that is not finished by Indian workers is illegal, not because of U.S. law, but because it is the Justice Department’s interpretation of a law in India. (If the same wood from the same tree was finished by Indian workers, the material would be legal.) This action was taken without the support and consent of the government in India.
 On August 24, 2011, around 8:45 a.m. CDT, agents for the federal government executed four search warrants on Gibson’s facilities in Nashville and Memphis and seized several pallets of wood, electronic files and guitars. Gibson had to cease its manufacturing operations and send workers home for the day, while armed agents executed the search warrants. Gibson has fully cooperated with the execution of the search warrants.
 • Raid shut down Gibson factories and cost company money - This is the second time that federal agents have raided Gibson facilities and disrupted production – this time causing lost productivity and sales.
 • Wood seized was Forest Stewardship Council Controlled - The wood the Government seized on August 24 is from a Forest Stewardship Council certified supplier and is FSC Controlled, meaning that the wood complies with the standards of the Forest Stewardship Council, which is an industry-recognized and independent, not-for-profit organization established to promote responsible management of the world’s forests. FSC Controlled Wood standards require, among other things, that the wood not be illegally harvested and not be harvested in violation of traditional and civil rights. See www.fsc.org for more information. Gibson has a long history of supporting sustainable and responsible sources of wood and has worked diligently with entities such as the Rainforest Alliance and Greenpeace to secure FSC certified supplies. The wood seized on August 24 satisfied FSC standards.
 • Nearly two years later, no charges have been filed - In 2009, more than a dozen agents with automatic weapons invaded the Gibson factory in Nashville. The Government seized guitars and a substantial amount of ebony fingerboard blanks from Madagascar. To date, 1 year and 9 months later, criminal charges have NOT been filed, yet the Government still holds Gibson’s property. Gibson has obtained sworn statements and documents from the Madagascar government and these materials, which have been filed in federal court, show that the wood seized in 2009 was legally exported under Madagascar law and that no law has been violated. Gibson is attempting to have its property returned in a civil proceeding that is pending in federal court.
 The Justice Department has asked the judge to stop the court case indefinitely.
 • Information sought in raid was already made available - Since 2009, Gibson has fully cooperated with the Government’s investigation of wood and has provided substantial documentation regarding Gibson’s wood-buying activities over the years. Yet, the Federal Government raided Gibson’s facilities on August 24, 2011, without warning or communication of any kind. Had the Government simply communicated with Gibson, Gibson would have cooperated without having to stop its production and send workers home.
 • Not about illegal logging, not about conservation, not about the environment - The U.S. Lacey Act does not directly address conservation issues but is about obeying all laws of the countries from which wood products are procured. This law reads that you are guilty if you did not observe a law even though you had no knowledge of that law in a foreign country. The U.S. Lacey Act is only applicable when a foreign law has been violated.
 • Gibson is innocent and will fight to protect its rights - Gibson has complied with foreign laws and believes it is innocent of ANY wrong doing. We will fight aggressively to prove our innocence.
 For more information, please contact:
Henry E. Juszkiewicz
c/o Gibson Guitar Corp.
309 Plus Park Blvd.
Nashville, TN 37217 As an aside, Gibson is a non-unionized shop while its competitors are largely unionized.
 And Gibson's CEO is a Republican donor while his competitors -- who import the exact same wood without complaint from the government -- are Democrat contributors.
 But I'm sure those are all just coincidences.

Shock: left-wing Democrat campaign treasurer arrested by FBI



This is only a guess, but Eric Holder must have been on vacation when this arrest was approved.
 FBI arrests prominent Democratic campaign treasurer A prominent Democratic campaign treasurer who works for federal, state and O.C. lawmakers including U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, Rep. Loretta Sanchez and state legislators Lou Correa and Jose Solorio has been arrested by the FBI on suspicion of mail fraud ... in connection with her position as a campaign treasurer.
 State Sen. Lou Correa told the Register on Saturday afternoon that he was called by the FBI late Friday night and told that [Kinde] Durkee had been arrested and that he is a likely victim along with “many, many other victims.” The Santa Ana Democrat said he believes he has lost “hundreds of thousands of dollars” in campaign funds.
 “This is clearly a sense of betrayal of someone I have trusted for a number of years,” said Correa, who has used Durkee as his campaign treasurer since 1995. “This is a punch straight to the gut.”
 ...Durkee also oversaw the political-action committees of the Democratic Party of Orange County and the Democratic Foundation of Orange County, among others... Durkee and Associates says on its website: “Since 1972 we have worked for 5 presidential campaigns, 4 gubernatorial campaigns, numerous senate, congressional, state and local candidates, initiatives, political action committees and many non-profit associates and small businesses.”
 Durkee has had enforcement actions taken against her four times by the state Fair Political Practices Commission, primarily for failing to report transactions or information. She has also received at least a half a dozen enforcement warning letters from the commission and stipulated to a violation before the City of San Diego Ethics Commission. Isn't this the fiscally responsible Democrat Party in microcosm?  Despite repeated reporting and ethics violations, the menagerie of left wing kooks continued using Durkee to handle their money.
 Couldn't happen to a nicer bunch of Marxists progressives.
 By the way, I simply adore what Kinde's done with her hair.

Good News: California Bans Styrofoam, Small Businesses Rejoice!*



*If you call rejoicing being really, really pissed off.  As if California hasn't done enough to alienate businesses -- withholding water from farmers, paying government bureaucrats outrageous salaries, enacting a thicket of regulations (said to cost half-a-trillion dollars in 2009), and levying punishing taxes -- its latest brilliant law ought to really help kick-start the economy.
 The dangerous, toxic substance known as styrofoam will finally be completely banned in California.
 Democratic state Sen. Alan Lowenthal's bill to put a stop to Styrofoam use in grocery stores, restaurants, and food vendors is set to pass in the Senate. It would be the first state-wide ban of Styrofoam in the country...
 Many have come to the aid of the ubiquitous containers: restaurant owners say the biodegradable alternatives are more expensive and less effective, while manufacturers like Dart claim they'll have to close two production plants that can't produce anything but Styrofoam.
 ...environmentalists are pleased to see a ban on the non-compost-able, non-biodegradable, chemical-laden receptacles... It would be interesting to see how this bill affects the rest of the nation, as California is commonly ahead of the curve on environmental law. And it's working out so well for them, eh?
 So, just to be clear: California's government-subsidized scientists have apparently determined that styrofoam is just as dangerous to humans as carbon dioxide.
 We may want to count this as reason #18,306 that this bluest of blue states is bankrupt, hemorrhaging businesses and about to tell its pensioners (politely) that they're screwed.  Yes, let's all emulate California, shall we?

For wont of $3 billion: the President's Priorities



"I have moved quickly to work with my economic team and leaders of both parties on an American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan that will immediately jump- start job creation and long-term growth ...this plan must begin today, a plan I am confident will save or create at least 3 million jobs over the next few years." --President-Elect Barack Obama, January 8, 2009 With another "jobs speech" scheduled for Thursday, it is worth remembering the speech President-Elect Barack Obama gave at George  Mason University the second week of 2009.  Obama asserted that only government -- through a  massive, $840 billion stimulus package -- could jump-start the stricken economy.
 In his 2009 speech, Obama promised to "put people to work repairing crumbling roads, bridges and schools by eliminating the backlog of well-planned, worthy and needed infrastructure projects", i.e., the infamous, "shovel-ready" construction projects that he later confessed didn't really exist.
 In fact, only six (6) percent of Stimulus spending went to construction projects; much of the rest redistributed wealth from the private sector to public sector unions.
 For wont of $3 billion, NASA loses manned space flight capability... In the midst of the Stimulus spending spree, President Obama shocked the NASA program with a devastating pronouncement.  The Space Shuttle replacement effort, dubbed the Constellation Program, which needed $3 billion in annual funding, would be terminated.
 For the first time since the initial manned flight of Project Mercury on April 18, 1961, the United States would not have the ability to put a man into space.  In spite of the national security impact of the space program -- and the fact that China has actively tested anti-satellite weaponry, the President felt that $3 billion was too much to spend on a replacement for the Space Shuttle.
 ...though illegal aliens received $4.2 billion in tax credits And it wasn't just the fact that the public sector unions were awash with hundreds of billions in taxpayer Stimulus cash: the waste, fraud, and abuse in other federal programs turned out to be equally outrageous.
  • The IRS sent $4.2 billion in tax credits to illegal aliens  • The EPA received an increase of $2.7 billion in funding from 2010 to 2011  • Spending on the Food Stamp program has more than doubled since 2009, to $71 billion in 2011  Priorities The President's priorities are funding his union boss supporters, growing the size of government bureaucracies, ringing up massive deficits, advancing the anti-jobs "green" agenda, and cutting back on strategic national security programs.
 Now I want you to imagine what Obama's priorities will be if he were to be reelected in 2012.  He would have absolutely nothing to lose in enacting an even more radical agenda:  his devastating policies will go from merely stunningly bad to spectacularly worse.
 And that is why he must be defeated next November.

'Who Is Larwyn?'



Many have called, emailed and even scrawled the question on hand-delivered notes: 'Who is Larwyn?', referring to the executive editor of our daily link roundups.  Tired of the incessant questions, I forwarded one on to Larwyn.  The response is delivered verbatim.I have been called a dynamic figure because I am often seen scaling walls and crushing ice. I have been known to remodel train stations on my lunch breaks, making them more efficient in the area of heat retention.I translate sign language while weaving in and out of heavy traffic. I write award-winning operas.I manage time efficiently. Occasionally, I tread water for three days in a row.I mesmerize people with my amazing trombone playing. I can pilot bicycles up severe inclines with unflagging speed, and I cook 30-minute brownies in 20 minutes.I am an active member of the following Mafias: Italian, Russian, American, Canadian, French, British, Spanish, German, Scandinavian, Czechoslovakian, Yugoslavian, Ukrainian, Romanian, and Antarctican. I am an expert in stucco, a veteran of the Foreign Legion, and an outlaw in Peru. Using only a hoe and a large glass of water, I once single-handedly defended a small village in the Amazon basin from a horde of ferocious army ants.I play bluegrass cello. I was scouted by the Mets. I am the subject of numerous documentaries. When I’m bored, I build large suspension bridges in my yard. I enjoy urban hang gliding.In my youth, on Wednesdays after school, I used to repair electrical appliances free of charge.I am an abstract artist, a concrete analyst, and a ruthless bookkeeper. Critics worldwide swoon over my original line of corduroy evening-wear.I don’t perspire. I am a private citizen, yet I receive fan mail. I have been caller number nine and have won weekend passes.  Last summer I toured New Jersey with a traveling centrifugal force demonstration.  I bat .400.  My deft floral arrangements have earned me fame in international botany circles.  Children trust me.I can hurl tennis rackets at small moving objects with deadly accuracy. I once read The Holy Bible, Paradise Lost, Moby Dick, and David Copperfield in one day and still had time to refurbish an entire dining room that evening.I know the exact location of every food item in every supermarket in New York City.I have performed several covert operations for United States intelligence organizations.  I sleep once a week; when I do sleep, I sleep in a chair.While on vacation in Canada, I successfully negotiated with a group of terrorists who had seized a small bakery.The laws of physics do not apply to me. I balance, I weave, I dodge, I frolic, and my bills are all paid.On weekends, to let off steam, I participate in full-contact origami.  Years ago I discovered the meaning of life, but forgot to write it down.I have made extraordinary four-course meals using only a blender and a toaster oven. I breed prize-winning clams.I have won bullfights in San Juan, cliff-diving competitions in Sri Lanka, and spelling bees at the Kremlin.I have played Hamlet, I have broken into and inhabited the Biosphere, I have performed open-heart surgery, and I have spoken with Elvis.There is more --- but much of it is too extreme to believe.

The Tax Tax



Papa B:
 Tax his land,
Tax his bed,
Tax the table,
At which he's fed.
 Tax his tractor,
Tax his mule,
Teach him taxes
Are the rule.
 Tax his work,
Tax his pay,
He works for
peanuts anyway!
 Tax his cow,
Tax his goat,
Tax his pants,
Tax his coat.
 Tax his ties,
Tax his shirt,
Tax his work,
Tax his dirt.
 Tax his tobacco,
Tax his drink,
Tax him if he
Tries to think.
 Tax his cigars,
Tax his beers,
If he cries
Tax his tears.
 Tax his car,
Tax his gas,
Find other ways
Taxes to pass
 Tax all he has
Then let him know
That you won't be done
Till he has no dough.
 When he screams and hollers;
Then tax him some more,
Tax him till
He's good and sore.
 Then tax his coffin,
Tax his grave,
Tax the sod in
Which he's laid...
 Put these words
Upon his tomb,
'Taxes drove me
to my doom...'
 When he's gone,
Do not relax,
Its time to apply
The inheritance tax. Accounts Receivable Tax
Building Permit Tax
Capital Gains Tax
Commercial Driver's License (CDL) Tax
Cigarette Tax
Corporate Income Tax
Dog License Tax
Driver's License Tax

 STILL THINK THIS IS FUNNY?
 Not one of these taxes existed 100 years ago, and our nation was the most prosperous in the world. We had absolutely no national debt, had the largest middle class in the world, and Mom could stay home to raise the kids. The last 80 years have seen the rise of a federal leviathan, unconstitutional in its genesis, unrelenting in its thirst for control, and inarguably destructive of liberty.
 Our founders and framers were brilliant human beings.  They anticipated and feared the rise of an immense, lawless, rogue, authoritarian, central government and they explicitly designed the Constitution to prevent it.
 But politically expedient criminals (for that's what they are: criminals) -- many malevolent, some merely useless idiots -- have collaborated to render our nation's highest law nearly meaningless.
 It took 80 years for us to get here and it may take 80 years for us to roll it back.  But roll it back we must, if we are to save this Republic for subsequent generations.

After Solyndra



Taxpayers are now on the hook for a $535 million loan to bankrupt solar panel maker Solyndra.  A top Obama donor -- billionaire George Kaiser -- now claims he didn't use his political influence to secure the federal loan.
 The foundation of Tulsa billionaire George Kaiser said it took a hit like all other investors in Solyndra, which this week shuttered its plant and laid off 1,100 workers. The California-based solar panel manufacturer won a $535 million government-backed loan to spur clean-energy innovation, but now taxpayers may be obligated to pay it back...
 ...In a Thursday statement, the George Kaiser Family Foundation said Kaiser, a major fundraising bundler for Obama, is not personally invested in Solyndra and “did not participate in any discussions with the U.S. Government regarding the loan.”  ...[But] Kaiser has been a frequent White House visitor. The recent failure of at least three major solar companies like Solyndra hasn't stopped the magnanimous bureaucrats at the Department of Energy from awarding $145M in "solar grants" (with your money, of course):
 In a week when the solar energy sector has been under fire, MIT and two Massachusetts are among the beneficiaries of a U.S. Department of Energy solar technologies program that has awarded $145 million to 69 organizations in 24 states.
 The DOE SunShot initiative is designed to help shape the next generation of solar energy technologies, according to a news release from the agency... American taxpayers have been funding the solar power delusion since the era of Jimmy Carter.
 It's about time we disbanded the Department of Energy's "green initiatives" program which has a perfect return-on-investment: zero for many billions of dollars.

What should have been today's headline in every newspaper in America



That is, if we had a real media in this country.
 "It was the first time since 1945 that the government has reported a net monthly job change of zero."
 After an exhausting nine days on Martha's Vineyard, followed by several campaign events, the President headed to Camp David yesterday for the long Labor Day weekend in order to golf, decompress and unwind.

 Moreover, AT&T is a tech laggard. Name any innovation in wireless and AT&T will land about dead last in the order of rolling it out, except for maybe one — locking up the iPhone for a long exclusive.
 Techies have already seemed to have forgotten that telecoms and the greater tech world are naturally enemies, and the carriers stifled innovation for as long as they could — until Apple blew a hole in their walled gardens." --Ryan Singel, "Why Feds Are Right to Block AT&T, T-Mobile Merger" Labels: Linkfest
