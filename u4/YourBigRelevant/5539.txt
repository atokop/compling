How I've dodged the demise of the east coast, part II: Goodnight, Irene





So after surviving the 5.8 earthquake the other day, I took my kids downtown DC 2 days later and got caught in a torrential downpour and lightning storm. Here it was, E Street, Thursday. 2 days before Irene:



We then decided to not go out of the house EVER AGAIN. We  waited for Hurricane Irene to visit. After all, Fox and CNN and EVERY STATION starting with a W foretold her path. One panicked reporter pondered out loud the horrific destruction caused by hurricane winds on top of loosened structures due to the earthquake. This prompted my family and I to nail ourselves to our kitchen. 

Then I did what other Washingtonians do: busted out and headed to the grocery store, breaking my self- imprisonment rule. C'mon, Irene (not to be confused with the classic '80s song C'mon Eileen), bring it. (Also, I got the LAST ROLL of toilet paper in the DC area! In fact, I got 24 of them.)

Here's what I bought. This was my entire hurricane preparedness strategy* (other than asking my husband and son to bring in the patio table.) 



On Friday, I watched  400 hour coverage of  Irene since this, apparently, was the week the east coast was going down. Mostly I watched Shepard Smith on Fox. He and I go way back: I slept with him during Hurricane Katrina. (Well, not actually 'slept with him,' but rather 'fell asleep to the sound of his strong yet slightly panicked voice while watching him every night'.) Shepard, I'm convinced, could tell me I WAS ABOUT TO BE HIT BY A METEOR IN 4.5 SECONDS and I would look up and cry. I ALWAYS share violent disasters with him. He speaks with authority and urgency...yes his voice alarms me, causes me a raise in blood pressure, but it's like a caffeine hit that you must have. (YOU WILL DIE TODAY FROM IRENE, I think I heard him say.)



Between Shep, and Govenor Christie in NJ, who so authoritatively said, "GET THE HELL OFF THE BEACH. IT'S WHAT, 4:30? YOU'VE MAXIMIXED YOUR TAN", (I loved this and replay it often) and Bloomberg, (who I think personally phoned me at 5:35pm to evacuate NYC, even if I was in DC, but it was a rambling phone message, so I'm really not sure it was him), I felt that these three men had things under control, and I should heed their warning and BE READY FOR MASSIVE NYC SHUTDOWNS. Or at least the shutdown of my coffee maker in DC. 

At 7:40 pm, when I heard some rain, I looked up from my book, and decided I should investigate and perhaps take a picture. After all, editors were offering close to 25 CENTS a photo. With my handy camera phone, I took this pic of the skies swirling around our cul-de-sac. It was not bought. 


We noted the strong winds and rain had picked up. But as I focused on Shep, I realized we were only hearing news of New York City's impending AT ANY MOMENT YOU WILL DIE disaster. I said to myself, self, what about Washington? Should we unwrap the new flashlight? 

We turned to CNN, and Wolf Blitzer was talking about our area. So I listened. But I missed Shep and his urgent voice, scaring me calmly. (It's a dysfunctional relationship, I know. He talks, I panic.) Wolf was lulling me to sleep, even if he was in my city, but I felt he understood. As I switched back and forth between various reporters live on the coast, I was worried for their safety: Doug McElway in Ocean City was  DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO BEING HIT BY A DOLPHIN.

So we hunkered down, waiting for news of our impending death. But I was now worried about Geraldo's safety. He told a couple that they had about 20 blocks to go until they were safe.  What if they and he don't make it? What if they stop at an empty bar instead? Clearly a worrier like me does not need to think about the shutdown of Irish pubs.

Soon we fell asleep and woke up in the morning with power (Thank you Dominion) and all family members alive (thank you God), but I had an overwhelming urge to check on Shepard Smith. And Doug McElway. And Chris Christie. And the people who didn't "get the hell off the beach." And quite possibly Dr. Phil. They would tell me like it is. 

I bolted to the TV, and they were all STILL THERE!

But their predictions of danger were correct; the east coast was now under water, roads washed away and trees were down in about a 1,000 mile radius. Except my suburb. Don't ask me why, but we dodged another disaster. I thanked God for sparing us again. We surely did not deserve this.

And now all I can think about is the people who woke up and have to vaccuum water out of their house. Or lift a tree off their roof. Or desperately need power for an oxygen tank to keep them alive. Or is holding their sick baby praying for power so that their humidifier works and he can breathe again.

 I think about the road and power and water crews who will be shoveling, chopping and moving  24/7 for the next weeks, and the emergency personnel always there. 

I think about all the travelers affected. (Which is apparently the entire country.)

I said a prayer for everyone, then shook my head as to why this stuff happens.

Then I investigated my neighborhood, looking for evidence of the earthquake and hurricane (and frogs and zombie apocalypse). The pond by my house looked just fine. 



 The landscaping we just put in the other day was just fine. 



A street sign was on the ground, but Irene placed it exactly on the same corner it was supposed to be on. (It was either her or the Homeowners Association, who was looking for vicious mulching violations when they came across said sign and set it down.) More destruction in my 'hood: some siding coming loose.


My thoughts though are with the good people--in NC, VA, NJ, Long Island, VT, to name a few-- who woke up today facing massive floods and destruction of much more than a street sign.

And, I hold no illusions. Next natural disaster, I have a feeling I won't be so lucky. There's no way we can dodge one again.

I just hope it's Shep who whispers in my ear: "Oh darlin', YOU MUST GET OUT OF THIS PATH OF SWARMS OF LOCUST SEIZING CONTROL OF THE MID-ATLANTIC. RIGHT NOW, PLEASE."

Goodnight, Irene.#

*Hurricane preparedness strategy devised in a high-level planning session with the neighbor, who once spoke to someone who spoke to an intern of a former governor of Virginia.

Life in DC/Northern Virginia: My really fantastical earthquake story!





The great Virginia earthquake of ’11 and I was in….the dog treat aisle.  

When yesterday’s 5.8 earthquake rocked the East Coast and rattled Washington DC to its core,  I was with my 3 kids at a Northern Virginia Wal-Mart, back to school shopping. We had bought a couple things for school at the front of the store, before I announced, “Wait, I must get detergent!” and zigzagged to the back of the store. My son remembered that our puppy had no treats left, so instead, we sidetracked to the dog aisle, and gathered around the MilkBones, weighing the merit of beef flavor? Or chicken flavor? Tofu mixed with pork and liver? Or the 99 cent kind? 
Ah, Beggin’ Bacon Strips. That’ll do it. And Mother Nature even agreed, because the entire aisle began shaking. A roar came through the ground and tried to swallow us, but only succeeded in shaking the store around.  I recognized it instantly as an earthquake. (As a person from Cleveland, I have no basis for this knowledge. Perhaps it was a guess.) I gathered my kids together in the center of the aisle to escape from falling Alpo. As all shelves for Walmart miles shook, I announced, “This is an earthquake!”
I grabbed my kids and pondered if we could actually get hurt by falling bacon, and then I remembered the ceiling beams above. Yep. That was infinitely more dangerous. 
Then I said it again, louder, as the rattling continued. “This is an earthquake!”
I’m not sure why I turned into a television reporter at that moment, actually. I felt the need to confirm to a random, confused woman in my aisle who questioned me: “Is this really an earthquake?”
“Yes,” I said. Clearly, I was Diane Sawyer. And then my daughter cried hearing my pronouncement. And I felt really bad  for confirming it to the world. (Or at least my aisle.) 
The rattling subsided after 20 seconds or so; the jolly green giant had stopped shaking the store. I hugged the kids, reminded them they were safe and said thanks to God that we were OK and no beams fell on us.  And no 300 pound bag of Puppy Chow did us in.* The kids and I walked to the front of the store to pay for our things (if I was a looter, I suppose I would’ve said, hey I got a crapload of stuff here! And everyone’s pretty shaken! Make a break for it!)But for some reason, I was overcome with the need to pay for my stuff.** 
But not before lapsing back into reporter mode. I snapped my one and only picture as I was passing aisles that had stuff everywhere.
And here it is, the unveiling of the photo of The Great Earthquake of ’11—Walmart Aisle Destruction.

Do not ask me why I picked an aisle with a fairly small amount of deodorant strewn about.  I really can’t imagine any of you saying, “Geez, Kris, that deodorant looks really scary.” (No doubt the empty cart there was from someone who clearly bolted at the sight of Old Spices flying.) 
You’d think I would’ve walked over to the TV aisle, and upon asking if anyone needed help, I could’ve at least taken a picture of some LCD 55”s shifting in their boxes.
But no, with my MamaBear instinct to escort my children out, and my Reporter instinct to tell the story, I took a picture of Speed Sticks.  Worse, I posted to Facebook to horrify 309 people in the world of the massive destruction here.
The kids and I put our stuff on the belt, and kept saying, “I can’t believe we were just in an earthquake.” The cashier looked sad. 
“I was in an earthquake in my country when I was a little girl, about her age,” she said softly, motioning towards my daughter.
And I felt bad again. This memory was clearly painful for her. I instantly thought of my dear friend Molly in Japan, who survived the true horrible devastation there. 
“What country?” I asked.
“Venezuala. Scary. Very scary.”
“I’m sorry,” I said. And as a mom, I touched my daughter. And as a human being, I prayed silently for that woman, and all those affected by earthquakes. And I thought of Molly again.  
As we walked out of the store, my son found a TV (just like a guy) in the credit union. 
“5.8 earthquake hits the Nation’s Capital,” CNN was reporting.
Seriously? We just went through a 5.8? I called my husband, who works in DC. We could not get through. 
Two hours later—at home—we finally reached his cell phone. 
“Hey,” I said.
“Hey,” he said.
“Wasn’t that wild?”
But he didn’t want to talk. He was now on a Metro train, crammed in with 35 million other Washingtonians, going 15 miles per hour. 
We expect him home by mid-March.#*I was pretty sure I did not want to be remembered as dying from falling Bacon Bits.**Those looting in London be sure to take note of proper chaos-behavior.

Re-evaluating your writing income: How Writers Need To Be Like Plumbers...and Harlan Ellison





I've re-evaluated things while on vacation in Florida.                       Only my family goes to the ocean during Shark Week, but I digress..... 

I spent an entire 13 hour drive thinking about my writing business. As any freelancer knows, it's feast or famine financially. One month, you've got several checks coming in, the next, nothing. And there's always the clients who promise payment, and it doesn't show up for months and months; or worse, the clients who ask you if you'll do just this one project for them, but they can't pay you--just offer you "exposure." (I always say no. Can I write "exposure" on my kid's orthodontist bill?) I'm always amazed, as I stand there when the plumber, appliance repairman, or heating/cooling guy shows up, fixes our stuff, and has me pay him right there for his labor--or at least sign a binding contract that I will pay---why some professional writers don't insist on the same set-up. 

In my little self-imposed exile on the car trip, between breaking up fights by 13, 11 and 8 year olds, I decided it's time to re-evaluate my biz, my time, my experience and my income. In other words, it's my business sabbatical for these few weeks before the kids go back to school. I'm still evaluating, because I don't think this type of thing is figured out overnight, but...I'm going to have to dump a couple low-paying jobs, so I can focus more on what I want to do: magazine writing for custom and mainstream publications. Those publications not only pay fairly, but usually pay on acceptance; and they usually value professional journalists...and have professional editors eye-balling your material. In fact, dare I say professional editors make your stuff better.

As I clarify my business and my time, while shedding some low-payers, I started googling this practice. And the key advice out there? Re-evaluate. Every year. Turns out, I'm doing the right thing. 

Check out this story: http://freelancefolder.com/17-sure-signs-that-your-freelancing-rates-really-are-too-low/

I urge you as a professional to do the same thing: look at your business, and truly study the numbers. Ask yourself:
-Is this project worth my time, education and experience, or am I working 60 hours a week with nothing or little to show for it?

And, I beg you, again,  professional freelance journalists do NOT take projects on for free, because maybe the "exposure" will help their career. It will devalue you and your product and service. 

Maybe it's time I trot out the ole Harlan Ellison clip, "Pay the Writer." He's animated, intense, passionate and fierce about the subject, and it charges me up every time. Take a peek--and fair warning, if there's little ears around, cover them. He uses strong language. 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mj5IV23g-fE

And after you've watched it, come back and tell me how you're re-evaluating your writing biz....

What's Your Presentation IQ? How One Fed-Turned-Author Can Help You Speak Up





Henry Lescault is a special agent and a liaison for Department of Justice's ATF, and the President and Founder of Zero In on Excellence LLC, but he can now add published author to his lengthy and impressive credentials.


With certifications and degrees in behavioral science, Henry is a great example of someone who has taken what he knows as a presenter, personal presence expert, and leadership coach, and, with co-author Arnold Sanow, turned it into a book to help those of us who quiver at the thought of a "presentation." 
As a 21-year veteran special agent, he's served as a leader andb rought some of the most violent criminals to justice. He's taught on individual and team interaction, and mastering change. He's had high tension leadership assignments ranging from undercover operations, tactical operations, complex criminal investigations of violent street gangs, firearm traffickers, to making countless expert presentations to Congress and government officials on behalf of their mission. (As a former public affairs person for ATF, I can attest to the intensity of work and the necessity of presentation skills, which Henry has mastered!) 
His newly-released book is Present with Power, Punch and Pizazz: The Ultimate Guide to Delivering Presentations with Poise, Persuasion and Professionalism. I caught up to Henry to ask him about his experiences in publishing his first book. 


Q: What is the book about?  A: The book is about how to deliver great presentations to any audience. Whether it's one person or 1000 people, how we present our topic and ourselves is critical to our success. Whether it's a job interview, a sales call, or a keynote speech, this book covers it all. Arnold (Arnold Sanow, my co-author) and I sought to write an easy to follow, easy to read, practical guide to making great presentations and to bringing your complete successful self to every situation. This book is a guide that you can pick up and immediately use to increase your presentation IQ and personal presence. 
Q: Who would most enjoy and benefit from reading this book? A: This is a great question because Arnold and I discussed this topic over and over again before committing it to paper. First, there was a great demand from the business world for a practical, easy to follow book about improving presentation skills. More and more, your presentation IQ and ability to express yourself and sell or relay information is critical to business success. Taking this into account, we also thought about everyday life. Through research and experience, we learned that EVERYONE is presenting themselves every day in some forum. One of the keys to remember about the principles in our book is that people are judging you the moment you walk into a room. Whether we like it or not, whether it's right or not, it's a fact. How you look, how you speak, what you say, and how you say it, are critical to your success in any situation. Whether you are speaking at a Board of Director's meeting, to a department store sales person, or 500 people at a conference, you have to put your best foot forward and be prepared. This book will get you there. The bottom line... it's for everyone.  
Q: How long did it take you to write? A: The book took us a year or so to write. We took our time, did the research, interviewed the right people, and made sure we were putting our best foot forward.  
Q: Who is the publisher, and where is it available?  A: The publisher is iUniverse (Barnes & Noble). It's available on Amazon, Barnes &;Noble stores and web site, Borders stores--while they are still open-- and web site. It's also available in e-book and hard cover and soft cover formats.  
Q: What most surprised you about the book process? A: I don't feel like there were many surprises. The publishing company was very straightforward and communicated with us throughout the entire process. I think the legwork is always a challenge. Interviewing very successful and busy people for the book is challenging, but also very rewarding. As you know, the discipline of writing is also challenging at times, especially when you are working full time and dealing with other life issues along the way. I was a little surprised by the level of excitement I experienced when I held the book in my hands for the first time. I never dreamed it would feel so good. I'm the type of person who likes to see the results of my labor and when I held that book in my hands, it was so real. I thought to myself "I've actually created something that can help others live a better life". That feels great. Q: How did you get a publishing deal?  A: My co-author and I self-published this book for a couple of reasons. It gave us more autonomy and control over the process, which we thoroughly enjoyed. My co-author has written and published many successful books throughout his consulting career and has experienced the methods of publishing. Receiving an advance and working through the requirement to pay it back through sales didn’t appeal to us once we did the research and spoke to those who have experienced both methods. It was so much easier to take care of it ourselves with the option to pitch the finished book, which looks better than a manuscript, to other publishing houses later IF we wanted to. 
Q: What is your advice to others considering writing a non-fiction book? A: My advice would be to know the market demand for your topic inside and out before you decide to write about it. Putting in all the work necessary to write, publish, and market your book should not be in vain. If you don’t know the market demand, then you are sort of writing in the blind, without a true direction to some extent. I’m not implying that you shouldn’t come up with new and creative ideas to write about. On the contrary, I believe that you should let your creativity flow and blend with the factual knowledge necessary to make your book desirable to your intended audience. Also, if you can, choose your topic, and try to apply it to the most general audience possible. For example, when we were getting a lot of requests for a book highlighting presentation skills from many companies, we first thought about focusing our book on the presentations skills necessary for those companies to be successful. We later broadened our scope and research to include presentation skills that could help a variety of people in a variety of business and even personal situations.  
Q: How are you marketing the book? A: Right now, we are using a couple of methods to market the book. First, we are testing the social media waters by marketing the book through outlets such as Facebook, LinkedIn etc.  Second, we are sending out free copies of the book to companies that market books and publications as well as to companies that could benefit from the skills taught in the book.  The book really serves two very important financial purposes for my co-author and I. First, and most obvious, is the money made from book sales, which as most people who have published books know, can be fair to minimal, depending on a lot of factors. Second and more importantly, the books serves as a business card/training tool for our public speaking, consulting and coaching practices. It’s not uncommon for us to carry around copies of the book to hand out to people who may bring us into their companies to consult, coach or teach their employees the important skills contained within it. We have both also found that once we get out there and start using the book in accordance with our business goals, word of mouth does the rest. 

So before we wrap up, Henry, can you tell us what we must know now in making a presentation?
I would recommend practicing a technique listed in the section "It's How You Say It-Not Just What You Say," that deals with increasing your approachability, likability, and trustworthiness during any presentation. Remember the acronym SOFTEN: Smile, Open Posture (to appear more open minded and approachable), Forward-leaning focus (to show interest), Territory (know your boundaries for personal space), Eye contact (helps establish trust) and Nodding (In the right context, it shows attentiveness and enthusiasm.)
Of course, there's more tips and tools in the book!
Thank you so much Henry for joining us, sharing your experience, and best of luck to you on your book! Thank you Kris, it's been my pleasure!

Does your business have a FB page?





After reading an excellent article on how journalists can be helped by maintaining a professional Facebook page for their writing business, I made the leap. Some say that no one is blogging anymore, and that this is a form of micro-blogging: go where your audience is, and with 750 million Facebook users, I'd say people are checking in there more than anywhere else!
I do hope you'll join me for "writerly" discussions and links, and you'll be the first to know how it's working. And tell me,  are you maintaining a separate Facebook account for your professional contacts, business, fellow writers, editors, and your readers? How is it working? https://www.facebook.com/home.php#!/pages/Kristine-Meldrum-Denholm-Writer/133124833434825

Can you go home again?





I had a wonderful 4th of July weekend: I went back home to Ohio.

I gazed at my favorite place in the world, Lake Erie...
(yes I took that blurry pic, it was from my phone, excuuuuuuuse me)

and saw fireworks in front of Mom's house...
And then had the traumatic experience of driving past my childhood home, where the new owners had trashed it...an unkempt yard, weeds, bushes with plastic or trash bags on them, dangling gold curtains in the garage, Christmas lights still up (or maybe they were 6 months early?)...it was depressing, when I think of all that it was: my dad had worked religiously on the yard and his garden, and my mom had made the inside neat and cozy, with geraniums always hanging from the front porch.

Aside from my old home, I enjoyed the good stuff of life over the 4th: my family and friends...a wonderful Italian dinner at the "Pope's table" at Buca di Beppo....my son getting to play in a baseball tournament with his beloved former team....the kids enjoying the hotel pool....the husband playing golf, taking our boys with him, so I could sneak in a little girl time with my daughter and my dear friend and her daughter....

But did you ever go home again and it isn't exactly what you remembered? Maybe the childhood house is gone...or worse, maybe everyone you used to visit is gone? Check out my story in this month's Life in the Finger Lakes Magazine, where I reminisce about days gone by at a summer vacation spot my family and I used to visit every year: Skaneateles, New York....and what happened when I finally went back with my own family.

What happens when what you remember isn't there anymore? When the town is there, but the people aren't? Do you still go and reminisce...or is it too bittersweet for you? My story rests safely on p. 89, and I do hope you'll read it and tell me your story. Can you go home again?

The Winner of "Chicken Soup for the Soul: A Dog's Life" is....





I tried to get my puppy to pick the winner of the contest for the Chicken Soup dog book that my story is in.

It was an #epicfail.



Oh, sure, she looks cute, but that's because I was holding a treat so she would sit still for .37 seconds to take a picture. Based on the fuzziness of the picture, you could see how well that worked.

So I put all the entries into Buckeye's duct tape bowl that my son made. 



OK, you can see the entries weren't exactly overflowing, but there were 11 of you I believe! If we only had this good of chances for the lottery!

Buckeye was going to eat each and every one of your names, so I called in a pro. The luckiest pro ever. My 8-year-old, who wins every contest known to man (seriously--we once had a call at dinner from Toys R Us telling her she had won a beautiful bike. She was 4 and the bike was for an 8 year old. We took it anyways, and she's now riding it!) and asked her to pick the winner.

And the winner is....

Holly Bowne!!! Congratulations, Holly! Please email me your address and I'll get your free copy of My Dog's Life out to you! (And of course, please go to p. 303 first:) )

And, if you're a writer-mom, please check out Holly's blog, Write Expressions...I love it! She's a talented writer with a gift for telling those everyday family stories---everything from the scary noises in her house, family vacations, to the loss of her friend, told so eloquently. You'll laugh and cry right along with her as she navigates her family life. 

Thank you all for entering... and congrats Holly!
