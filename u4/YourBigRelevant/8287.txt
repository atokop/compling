2011-08-24: 
					 Russia's Mission Control Moscow reported that communication with the Progress 44 cargo craft was lost shortly after its launch today (Aug. 24). The vehicle failed to reach orbit and crashed back to Earth. But what exactly was it? Progress spacecraft are automated, unpiloted and single-use vehicles that have delivered fuel and supplies to the International Space Station three to four times each year since 2001. The Progress spacecraft design was modeled after Russia's Soyuz space capsule, which , but it is specially modified to carry cargo instead of people. Like the Soyuz, but can also be remote-controlled by...

The ISS Progress 44 spacecraft and nearly 3 tons of supplies for the International Space Station were lost Wednesday when the launch vehicle experienced a failure during the climb to orbit. The launch took place as scheduled at 9 am EDT Wednesday from Baikonur Cosmodrome (7 pm Baikonur time). However, Mission Control Moscow reported communication with the Progress 44 was lost 5 minutes, 50 seconds after its launch. "At 1300 (GMT), we lifted off, following 320 seconds of flight there was a failure in the upper stage of the launch vehicle. We lost comm(unications) after a while with the launch vehicle and we did not report stage separation," said Maxim Matuchen, the head of the Russian Mission Control Center. International Space Station Program Manager Michael Suffredini held a news conference at the Johnson Space Center discussing the loss of the resupply vehicle and the impact it may have on the program and the crew. There are plenty of supplies to support the crew, and the station is in a good configuration. However, a Russian commission will be formed to investigate the root cause of the vehicle loss which may affect upcoming Russian spacecraft launches. The Expedition 28 crew continued to prepare for the planned departure of three crew members, although the exact date of that upcoming departure is being reviewed following today's Progress loss, and continued with science activities. Commander Andrey Borisenko and Flight Engineers Alexander Samokutyaev and Ron Garan <b>...</b>

October 15, 2009 - Baikonur Cosmodrome. A new Progress cargo resupply vehicle launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan to the International Space Station at 9:14 pm EDT Wednesday, Oct. 14. Less than nine minutes later, the ISS Progress 35 reached its preliminary orbit and deployed its solar arrays and navigational antennas. It replaces the trash-filled Progress 34 which undocked on Sept. 21 and was destroyed on re-entry into Earths atmosphere over the Pacific on Sept. 27. Progress 35 is set to dock to the station on Saturday, Oct. 17 at 9:41 pm with more than two tons of oxygen, air, propellant and other supplies and equipment aboard. The station's 35th Progress unpiloted spacecraft brings to the orbiting laboratory 1918 pounds of propellant, 110 pounds of oxygen and air, 926 pounds of water and 1750 pounds of spare parts and supplies for the Expedition 21 crew. Once the Expedition 21 crew members have unloaded the cargo, Progress 35 will be filled with trash and station discards. It will be undocked from the station and like its predecessors deorbited to burn in the Earth's atmosphere. The Progress is similar in appearance and some design elements to the Soyuz spacecraft, which brings crew members to the station, serves as a lifeboat while they are there and returns them to Earth. The aft module, the instrumentation and propulsion module, is nearly identical. But the second of the three Progress sections is a refueling module, and the third, uppermost as the <b>...</b>

A Soyuz-U rocket, carrying the ISS Progress 44 cargo ship bound to the International Space Station, ISS, lifted off from Site 1 in Baikonur into a cloudless sky on Wednesday at 17:00:08 Moscow Summer Time. The separation of the cargo ship from its rocket was expected at 17:09. However shortly after the launch, Russian space agency, Roskosmos, announced that a failure of the propulsion system on the third stage of the launch vehicle led to its premature emergency shutdown 325 seconds after a liftoff and the loss of the payload. The timing of the failure indicated that the engine on the third stage fired for less than a quarter of its planned duration. According to NASA, mission control in Houston received a report about 'off-nominal situation' during the launch five minutes 50 seconds after the liftoff. At the time, the agency had already posted a note about the successful launch on its web site. The official RIA Novosti news agency reported that the remnants of the cargo ship or its launch vehicle had crashed in the Choisk Region of Russia's Altai Republic around 17:25 Moscow Time. Later during the day, the impact point was narrowed down to the Bezhel Bik forest, some 40 kilometers from the nearest town of Karakoksha. The agency quoted local residents reporting a huge explosion in the hard-to-reach wooded area resulting in broken windows as far as 100 kilometers from the epicenter. There were no immediate reports of casualties. The search for the remnants of the vehicle <b>...</b>
