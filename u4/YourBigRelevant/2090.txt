Today at the Cafe: Bono and The Edge








I'm not afraid
Of anything in this world
There's nothing you can throw at me
That I haven't already heard
I'm just trying to find
A decent melody
A song that I can sing
In my own company

I never thought you were a fool
But darling, look at you. Ooh.
You gotta stand up straight, carry your own weight
'Cause tears are going nowhere baby

You've got to get yourself together
You've got stuck in a moment
And now you can't get out of it
Don't say that later will be better
Now you're stuck in a moment
And you can't get out of it


I will not forsake
The colors that you bring
The nights you filled with fireworks
They left you with nothing
I am still enchanted
By the light you brought to me
I listen through your ears
Through your eyes I can see

You are such a fool
To worry like you do.. Oh
I know it's tough
And you can never get enough
Of what you don't really need now
My, oh my

You've got to get yourself together
You've got stuck in a moment
And you can't get out of it
Oh love, look at you now
You've got yourself stuck in a moment
And you can't get out of it
Oh lord look at you now
You've got yourself stuck in a moment
And you cant get out of it

I was unconscious, half asleep
The water is warm 'til you discover how deep
I wasn't jumping, for me it was a fall
It's a long way down to nothing at all

You've got to get yourself together
You've got stuck in a moment
And you can't get out of it
Don't say that later will be better
Now you're stuck in a moment
And you can't get out of it

And if the night runs over
And if the day won't last
And if your way should falter
Along this stony pass

It's just a moment
This time will pass

Bono

Tonight at the Cafe: My Back Pages





Yes, it's been that kind of a year.



Crimson flames tied through my ears
Rollin’ high and mighty traps
Pounced with fire on flaming roads
Using ideas as my maps
“We’ll meet on edges, soon,” said I
Proud ’neath heated brow
Ah, but I was so much older then
I’m younger than that now

Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth
“Rip down all hate,” I screamed
Lies that life is black and white
Spoke from my skull. I dreamed
Romantic facts of musketeers
Foundationed deep, somehow
Ah, but I was so much older then
I’m younger than that now

Girls’ faces formed the forward path
From phony jealousy
To memorizing politics
Of ancient history
Flung down by corpse evangelists
Unthought of, though, somehow
Ah, but I was so much older then
I’m younger than that now

A self-ordained professor’s tongue
Too serious to fool
Spouted out that liberty
Is just equality in school
“Equality,” I spoke the word
As if a wedding vow
Ah, but I was so much older then
I’m younger than that now

In a soldier’s stance, I aimed my hand
At the mongrel dogs who teach
Fearing not that I’d become my enemy
In the instant that I preach
My pathway led by confusion boats
Mutiny from stern to bow
Ah, but I was so much older then
I’m younger than that now

Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats
Too noble to neglect
Deceived me into thinking
I had something to protect
Good and bad, I define these terms
Quite clear, no doubt, somehow
Ah, but I was so much older then
I’m younger than that now

B. Dylan

Breaking the Bonds of Affection: Denver 2000 Revisited





Susan Russell, the former head of Integrity, has now publicly admitted that the the landmark resolution D039 from the Episcopal General Convention "Denver 2000" was indeed a political maneuver crafted by political organizers not to be as it was promoted at the time to be a compromise between two sides working hard to build trust and commitment, but actually to achieve long-term political results at the expense of that trust and commitment.

In a post on the late Pamela Chinnis, the former House of Deputies president who passed away this week, Susan writes on the landmark General Convention Resolution DO39, "The resolution was crafted knowing that the “8th Resolve” was going to be a bridge-too-far for this convention. And so when it came to pass in the legislative process that it was separated off and failed by a narrow margin, our strategists inwardly celebrated the victory ..."

It was in fact their intention to see the final resolve struck (which would have called for the creation of liturgies for same sex blessings) and instead lay the significant foundation for Minneapolis 2003 when the Episcopal Church took major actions to break what the Windsor Report would describe as the "bonds of affection" with the Anglican Communion, as well as within the church itself.

As we can see in this post, the "bonds of affection" were in fact broken in 2000, not 2003. I can remember conservative bishops at that time working so hard to find some way to bridge the enormous gap between the two sides and hold the church together.  Who would not want to affirm that God loves all persons, but now we see it was premeditated and intentionally designed all along to be reinterpreted as an endorsement of communion-breaking actions, with the full support of the church hierarchy.

In fact, D039 led to a tremendous loss after Denver 2000 with the departure of major evangelical leadership with the formation of what would become the Anglican Mission in America (AMIA, now Anglican Mission in the Americas) and the emergency consecration of Chuck Murphy and John Rodgers by two overseas Anglican archbishops.  It was never the intention of the entrenched Episcopal leadership to ever do that theological work, which we can see now the AMiA and other global Anglican leadership recognized.

What had been hoped to be a stop-gap measure to prevent the church from splitting apart in schism, we now see in Susan's admission became the very catalyst that broke the church apart.

Breaking News: Earthquake/Aftershock 4.5 in Virginia





Info is here.

From the L.A. Times:

 
 As if the East Coast's magnitude 5.8 earthquake wasn't distressing enough, Virginia's got a whole lotta shaking going on.

A 4.5 aftershock struck near Richmond early Thursday, the U.S. Geological Survey said on its website. The temblor, which hit at 1:07 a.m. Eastern time, was centered in the same area as Tuesday's earthquake. The epicenter was about 36 miles northwest of Richmond and about 80 miles southwest of Washington.

And that's not the only aftershock: The Geological Survey lists four others since Tuesday's 1:51 p.m. quake: 3.4, 4.2, 2.8 and 2.2.

But in the greater scheme of things, that's a remarkably low number of aftershocks, geophysicist Amy Vaughan of the National Earthquake Information Center in Colorado told the Associated Press.  

Thursday’s earthquake was at a depth of 3 miles below ground — about the same as Tuesday’s quake.

A Geological Survey map of the shake zone estimated that the perceived shaking at the epicenter was moderate, with potential damage very light. http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/shakemap/global/shake/c0005jg1/ In contrast, Tuesday’s quake was classified as having very strong shaking.
And the New York Post:
The US Geological Survey (USGS) registered a 4.5-magnitude earthquake in Virginia early Thursday morning, less than two days after a 5.8-magnitude earthquake rattled a wide swath of the eastern US.

The USGS said the tremor struck shortly before 1:10am at a depth of 3.1 miles (5km), just south of Cuckoo, Va. -- 36 miles (58km) northwest of Richmond.

It was the strongest aftershock registered since Tuesday's major earthquake that forced at least partial evacuations of the US Capitol building and White House in Washington, D.C., as well as the Pentagon in Virginia.

Steve Jobs resigns as Apple CEO





Here is Steve Job's Letter of Resignation:



Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs

To the Apple Board of Directors and the Apple Community:

I have always said if there ever came a day when I could no longer meet my duties and expectations as Apple's CEO, I would be the first to let you know. Unfortunately, that day has come.

I hereby resign as CEO of Apple. I would like to serve, if the Board sees fit, as Chairman of the Board, director and Apple employee.

As far as my successor goes, I strongly recommend that we execute our succession plan and name Tim Cook as CEO of Apple.

I believe Apple's brightest and most innovative days are ahead of it. And I look forward to watching and contributing to its success in a new role.

I have made some of the best friends of my life at Apple, and I thank you all for the many years of being able to work alongside you.

Washington National Cathedral damaged in earthquake





UPDATE - Here's a video of damage being assessed at the National Cathedral from The Atlantic:



BB NOTE: No worries, the Darth Vader Gargoyle appears to be unharmed.  

From here:



Cathedral damaged from earthquake, including its spires.

An unusual magnitude-5.8 earthquake that struck in central Virginia during the early afternoon Aug. 23 significantly damaged the central tower of Washington National Cathedral about 84 miles to the northeast.

Cathedral spokesman Richard Weinberg told Episcopal News Service by phone later in the afternoon that the finials or capstones, which are shaped like fleurs-de-lis, fell off three of the four pinnacles (corner spires) of the "Gloria in Excelsis" central tower.

There are also cracks in some of the flying buttresses around the east end of the apse, and pinnacles fell from the west front and the apse, he said. The east end is the oldest part of the cathedral.

The buttresses around the central tower seem to be sound, according to a late-afternoon press release from the cathedral. And, despite some cracks on upper floors in the interior, no damage to the stained-glass windows has been reported.

The cathedral was evacuated, said Weinberg, who estimated that about 300 people, including staff, were in the building when the quake occurred. The cathedral will remain closed at least for the rest of the day as engineers and stonemasons assess the building. Weinberg said it is not known when the cathedral will re-open to visitors.


Read it all here.

Here is a video tour of the National Cathedral before the earthquake:

BREAKING NEWS: Earthquake!





Just doing work at my desk at home when the earthquake hit.  I've been through a minor earthquake in Hawaii and of course the usual tremors in California - but this was like nothing I have been through.  The building was shaking - I am on the top floor and it just kept shaking and shaking as stuff fell all over the place.  Stuff is smashed in my apartment but the building seems okay.  The cat was the smartest one  - she went and burrowed under a sturdy piece of furniture in the interior bathroom.  But she is not speaking to me right now.



The Washington Cathedral sustains damage.
I am still shaking - this was amazing.  Have to plug the TV back in - it fell over as well so haven't seen pictures.  I kept saying out loud, "It's okay, I can handle stress!  It's okay!"

Just talked to my sister-in-law who is from San Jose, California but lives nearby me here in Virginia.  She was visiting her eighty year old father at his house in Burke.  Until recently he was a long-time resident of San Jose but now lives here.  When the earthquake ended there was silence and then he turned to his daughter and said rather calmly, "well, that was a bout a 5."

LATER: One of the smashed things was my collector's edition of a Ronald Reagan Jelly Bean Jar.  My George W. Bush Jack-in-the-Box also crashed to floor and W popped out.  But Grandma's China is okay.

A Prayer for Resolution

O Father, in this time of deep separation in our beloved church, we offer this prayer for the just and amicable resolution of the litigation we are  facing, for the healing of broken relationships,  for the softening of  hearts hardened by hostility, and for common ground in our Common Prayer. Please help us all to be empowered by your Holy Spirit to dedicate our mutual resources for your work and glory, not our own, that we may find some good to come from this conflict that  has engaged us for so long. Hear us, Lord, we pray, in the name of your Son, Jesus  Christ. Amen.Resolution endorsed by the 216th Annual Council of the Diocese of Virginia:Resolved, That the 216th Annual Council request the members of the  Diocese of Virginia, corporately and individually, to commit to praying  regularly for God's guidance for the resolution of the property issues  in the Diocese that are presently the subject of litigation.To God be the glory.
