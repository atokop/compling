Winchester Mystery House





Location: San Jose, California   Coordinates: 37°19′6.10″N 121°57′2.74″W   Built: 1884   Architectural style: Queen Anne Style Late Victorian   Governing body: Private    The Winchester Mystery House is a well-known mansion in California. It once was the personal residence of Sarah Winchester, the widow of gun magnate William Wirt Winchester.  It was continuously under construction for 38 years and is reported to  be haunted. It now serves as a tourist attraction. Under Winchester's  day-to-day guidance, its "from-the-ground-up" construction proceeded  around the clock, without interruption, from 1884 until her death on  September 5, 1922, at which time work immediately ceased.The cost for such constant building has been estimated at about US $5.5 million (if paid in 1922; this would be equivalent to over $71 million in 2010).The Queen Anne Style Victorian  mansion is renowned for its size and utter lack of any master building  plan. According to popular belief, Winchester thought the house was  haunted by the ghosts of the people who fell victim to Winchester  rifles, and that only continuous construction would appease them. It is  located at 525 South Winchester Blvd. in San Jose, CaliforniaDeeply saddened by the deaths of her daughter Annie in 1866 of marasmus, and her young husband in 1881, Winchester consulted a medium on the advice of a psychic. The "Boston Medium" told Winchester that she believed there to be a curse upon the Winchester family because the guns they made had taken so many lives.  The psychic told Winchester that "thousands of people have died because  of it and their spirits are now seeking deep vengeance." Although this is disputed, popular belief holds that the Boston Medium told Winchester that she had to leave her home in New Haven and travel West,  where she must "build a home for yourself and for the spirits who have  fallen from this terrible weapon, too. You must never stop building the  house. If you continue building, you will live forever. But if you stop,  then you will die." Winchester left her New Haven home and headed for California. In 1884  she purchased an unfinished farm in Santa Clara Valley, and began  building her mansion. Carpenters were hired and worked on the house day  and night until it became a seven story mansion.  The June 1937 issue of Modern Mechanix  relates the story from then-current accounts as follows: "Winchester  and the baby girl died suddenly and Mrs Winchester, stunned by the  tragedy, fell into a coma so serious that physicians despaired of her  life. "Finally she recovered and, at a friend’s suggestion, visited a  medium. During a séance, according to those familiar with her story, she  received a communication from her dead husband in which he said: 'Sarah  dear, if our house had not been finished, I would still be with you. I  urge you now to build a home, but never let it be finished, for then you  will live. Another version of the story says that after the deaths of her  daughter and later her husband, she consulted a medium who told her that  she must build a house and never cease building it, otherwise the  spirits that killed her family members would come after her, too. After  that she began construction on the maze-like house full of twists,  turns, and dead ends, so that the spirits would get lost and never be  able to find her. One version states "She believed her only chance of a normal life was  to build a house, and keep building it. If the house was never  finished, no ghost could settle into it. The house contains many  features that were utilized to trap or confuse spirits. There are doors  that are small or lead nowhere and windows that look into other parts of  the house. The mansion may be huge but there are only two mirrors in  the whole place. This is because Sarah believed that ghosts were afraid  of their own reflection. Astute readers will notice that this makes no  sense at all. Winchester inherited more than $20.5 million upon her husband's death. She also received nearly 50 percent ownership of the Winchester Repeating Arms Company, giving her an income of roughly $1,000 per day, none of which was taxable until 1913.  This amount is roughly equivalent to about $22,000 a day in 2010. All  of this gave her a tremendous amount of wealth to fund the ongoing  construction."

China deploys advanced n-missile on Indian border




Written By Decentworld.in on 25 Aug 2011 | 09:55


China has deployed more advanced and  survivable solid-fuel nuclear capable CSS-5 MRBM missiles against India  as a 'deterrent posture', Pentagon has said warning that a high degree  of mistrust continues to strain their bilateral ties.   The PLA has replaced liquid-fuelled,  nuclear-capable CSS-2 IRBMs with more advanced and survivable  solid-fuelled CSS-5 MRBM systems to strengthen its deterrent posture  relative to India, the Pentagon has said in its annual report on Chinese  military build up to the Congress.   The report also says that Beijing is pumping in  huge investments on border infrastructure developments laying more roads  and rail network along the Sino-Indian border.   "Although this construction is primarily aimed at  facilitating economic development in western China, improved roads could  also support PLA border defense operations," it said.  Pentagon said that New Delhi remains  concerned by China's close military ties with Pakistan and its growing  footprints in the Indian Ocean, Central Asia and Africa. The report  noted that Pakistan continued to be China's primary customer for  conventional weapons and sales to Islamabad included newly rolled out  JF-17 fighters with production facilities, F-22P frigates with  helicopters, early warning and control aircraft, tanks, K-8 trainers,  F-7 fighters, air-to-air missiles, anti-ship cruise missiles and missile  technologies.   On Sino-Indian ties, Pentagon said, that though  bilateral dialogue between the two nations increased, border tensions  remained an irritant.    "China deepened its ties with India through  increased trade and high-level dialogues in 2010, though border tensions  remained an irritant in the bilateral relationship. Bilateral trade in  2010 reached nearly USD 60 billion," Pentagon said.

Apple shares fall after CEO Steve Jobs quits





 Shares of Apple Inc (AAPL.O)  fell more than 4 percent in pre-market trading on Thursday, a day after  its iconic CEO Steve Jobs resigned, leaving right-hand man Tim Cook to  take on the mantle. The resignation sparked worries that his health has deteriorated further. Jobs has survived a rare form of pancreatic cancer."While  the news could weigh on shares in the near term, we think the company's  model is built to last, sustaining a digital way of life that other  industry participants have yet to rival," J.P. Morgan said in a research  note to clients.The brokerage  said the news would create an attractive entry point for investors  looking to build bigger positions in Apple and reiterated its  "overweight" rating on the company.The  Cupertino, California-based company's shares fell to $360 in trading  before the bell. They closed at $376.18 on Wednesday on Nasdaq.

Top 5 Reasons Why Skype Wants GroupMe





  [1]  Following acquisition of video streaming service Qik  earlier this year, Skype's role as an innovator in driving unique mobile  user experiences grew bigger. The latest acquisition augments that  role.     With GroupMe, Skype can create the future of real-time communications so  people can easily stay connected to family, friends, clients and  colleagues anywhere in the world. On the other hand, GroupMe also gets  access to Skype’s 175 million monthly connected users.   [2]  Skype already offers voice and video calling, SMS, and  basic one-on-one instant messaging service but GroupMe will bring group  messaging services to its product lineup.     GroupMe's group messaging experience works across multiple mobile  devices and platforms, it sits on top of text messaging and is  independent of wireless data. Most importantly, it will help Skype  seamlessly integrate into social networks and pose challenge to Google+  Huddle and even Hangouts. In a way, Skype is making sure that it has its  group communication bases covered.   [3]  Om Malik at GigaOM  has an interesting take on the deal. "Skype can use GroupMe and other  apps it is buying up to build a communication platform for Microsoft’s  Windows Phone 7 offering. That would make a lot of strategic sense. In  addition, it would allow Skype/Microsoft to have a hedge against  Facebook," Malik said.   [4]   Grouping friends is the biggest problem social network sites are facing  and nobody knows that better than Facebook and Twitter.
 However, like Google+ Circles, classifying relationships is GroupMe's  specialty. And Skype was quick to realize that. "We share a very similar  vision, if not the same vision," GroupMe co-founder Jared Hecht said.  "We were on the exact same page when it came to what we really thought  were important issues in social, the future of social--that being,  helping people better interact with their intimate, real-life network.  It was a no-brainer for us."  [5]  The GroupMe deal is a product acquisition. Skype, which is  an online messaging and phone service that uses voice-over-Internet  technology, was attracted to GroupMe because the latter offers a  group-texting service that creates a virtual chat room around text  messages.
 Using GroupMe, you can create a phone number that anyone who signs up to  the group can text. The text can be delivered to anybody or everybody  in the group and you can make as many groups as you want. Another  interesting feature of GroupMe is that it works for conference calls as  well — anyone can dial the GroupMe number and start a group chat. And as  nobody knows better than Skype the enormous value group texting  carries, it didn't hesitate to swallow GroupMe.
 Skype said in a blog post  that GroupMe complements its "existing leadership in voice and video  communications by providing best in class mobile text-based  communications and innovative features around group messaging that  enable users to connect, share locations and photos and make plans with  their closest ties."
 However, the deal is as much a talent acquisition as it is a product  acquisition because it helps Skype bring on board savvy engineers and  professionals without having to poach them with sweet deals or spend a  lot of time hunting down talent. Let's not forget, the twentysomething  GroupMe co-founders Jared Hecht and Steve Martocci were able to turn a  hackathon idea into a working and popular application and were able to  build an entire company within the span of a year.

Apple iPad 3 With Retina Display to Ship in Early 2012





 Apple will kick off the trial production of iPad 3, the next  generation model of its best-selling tablet iPad in October and is  gearing up for a full-fledged launch in early 2012. But what features  will it boast of?
The Cupertino-based company is planning to fit iPad 3 with retina  display, which technically will double the screen resolution from  1024x768 to 2048x1536.This isn't surprising because the latest generation iPhone - iPhone 4 - comes with retina display too.Moreover, the rumor that iPad 3 will be released in early 2012 falls in line with an earlier report from DigiTimes that  release of iPad 3 has been delayed from Fall 2011 to the first quarter  of 2012 because Apple's retina display suppliers are finding it  difficult in reaching the target numbers.  Furthermore, a release in early 2012 would coincide with the launch  schedules of the previous two iPads. The original iPad was launched on  April 3, 2010, with its successor arriving less than a year later on  March 2, 2011.The Wall Street Journal was  the first to unleash the latest rumor on iPad 3. Citing unnamed  sources, the venerable newspaper said iPad 3 will be hitting stores  early in 2012 and testing of the device will commence this year in  October.  An Apple component supplier told WSJ that Apple has already placed  orders for parts of 1.5 million iPad 3s in the fourth quarter."Suppliers will ramp up production and try to improve the yield rate  for the new iPad in the fourth quarter before its official launch in  early 2012," a person at the supplier told WSJ.  The rumors on iPad 3 swirling on the Web say the tablet will be  thinner, lighter and faster than existing models and will be equipped  with a better screen.Apple's iPad is a huge success - as of early August, an estimated 29  million iPads have been sold since the tablet went on sale in April  2010, which will help the tablet own 61 percent of the market by the end  of the year. The technology giant also said it sold 9.25 million units  of the tablet in the fiscal third quarter or nearly a triple of what it  sold a year earlier. However, iPad is feeling the heat from rival  tablets such as Motorola Xoom and Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1. The latter,  which is slightly thinner and lighter, especially is threatening to end  iPad's dream run. Though similarly priced, Galaxy Tab is equipped with  better front-facing and rear-facing cameras and a bigger screen.  While ZTE Corp, Toshiba Corp, Lenovo, Sony and ASUS have launched  tablets with specs similar to iPad, online retail giant Amazon is also  expected to launch a new Kindle-type tablet that will threaten the iPad.Amidst this growing competition, iPad needs to distinguish itself from the rest if it has to retain its control over the market.  Of course, Apple has one less competitor to worry about now that HP  has dropped out of the tablet race, but it can't afford to wait for its  rivals to catch up, or worse, surpass it with features and performance.Unfortunately, Apple is notoriously secretive about new product  launches and so we don't know for sure what features will iPad 3 boast  of.

Virginia Earthquake 23 Aug 2011





  The 5.8 magnitude Virginia earthquake of 2011 occurred at  1:51 p.m. (EDT) Tuesday, Aug. 23, in the Central Virginia Seismic Zone,  which is believed to have produced the strongest magnitude in the  history of Virginia in May 1897, a 5.9 earthquake in Giles County.   The U.S. Geological Survey says the area has produced “small and moderate earthquakes since at least the 18th century.” The last known earthquake to have originated from the zone's  epicenter occurred in 1875, when effective seismographs were not  invented, but the damage from the shock suggested that it had a  magnitude of about 4.8, USGS said. “The 1875 earthquake shook bricks from chimneys, broke plaster and  windows, and overturned furniture at several locations,” the agency's  statement said. Another earthquake from the Central Virginia Seismic Zone that caused  minor damage occurred Dec. 9, 2003, and had a magnitude 4.5. Though Virginia earthquakes rarely have caused injury, tremors can be felt over a wide region.
East of the Rockies, an earthquake can be felt over an area as much  as 10 times larger than a similar magnitude earthquake on the West  Coast,” USGS stated. Here are a few maps that explain the earthquake, its locations,  shocks that were felt across eastern U.S., damages it caused and more.According to the USGS PAGER (Prompt Assessment of Global Earthquakes for  Response) system that provides shaking, fatality and economic loss  impact estimates following significant earthquakes worldwide, the  shaking alert level for the Virginia earthquake is orange, which  accounts for economic losses only. Significant damage is likely and the  disaster is potentially widespread.

Interesting science facts - 50 amazing science facts




Written By Decentworld.in on 20 Aug 2011 | 07:31


 1. Word "Science" derives from Latin word scientia meaning knowledge.
 2. Human need approximately 12 hours in order to entirely digest the food.   3. Brain cells are the longest living cells in our body, they can last for an entire lifetime.   4. Some human brains are bigger than other and the biggest human brain weighed 2,3 kg.   5. Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system with surface temperature above 450 C.   6. If we are to believe scientists there are approximately 50,000,000,000 galaxies "out there".   7. Sound travels 4 times faster in water than in air.   8. One of the most accidental discoveries was the one of microwave. This  discovery happened after a researcher walked by a radar tube and a  chocolate bar melted in his pocket.   9. Kissing or shaking hands? In terms of germs be aware that more germs are transferred shaking hands than kissing.   10. Our moon is extremely dry, it is for instance one million times drier than the infamous Gobi Desert.   11. The highest recorded temperature on Earth was measured in Libya in 1922, and it was 58°C.   12. The lowest recorded temperature on our planet was -89.6°C. This was measured in Antarctica in 1983.   13. Not all animals on our planet have brains, for instance starfish do not have brains.   14. Kangaroos are lacking ability to walk backwards.   15. Eyes always remain same in size since the time we are born and till  the moment we die, unlike our ears and nose that are constantly growing  throughout our life.   16. Only humans have ability to sleep on their backs.   17. Our brain isn't much different than the rest of our body in terms of water since 80 % of our brain is water.   18. Our brain for proper functioning needs about quarter of total oxygen used by our body.   19. Crocodiles are not only swallowing unlucky victims but also the stones in order to help them dive deeper.   20. While cancer is perhaps the greatest disease of humanity, sharks do  not have this problem as they are totally immune to cancer.   21. Surprisingly enough little mosquito has 47 teeth.   22. Ants are so hardworking that they even do not sleep.   23. In terms of rapid procreation rats lead the way since two rats can  have after year and the half more than 1 million descendants.   24. Our fingernails are growing much faster than our toenails, about 4 times faster.   25. Talking about the hot stuff - The highest temperature produced in a  laboratory was 920,000,000 F (511,000,000 C) at the Tokamak Fusion Test  Reactor in Princeton, NJ, USA.   26. Hurricanes cause havoc which is really no surprise since a typical  hurricane produces the energy equivalent to 8,000 one megaton bombs.   27. Polar bears may look slow and fat, but they are in real life far  from it since they can run at 25 miles an hour and jump over 6 feet in  the air.   28. Mosquitoes like women more than men since they very much like smell of estrogen.   29. In case you have ever wondered why giraffes are such a quiet animals  it is because they have no vocal chords to make any noise.   30. Interesting enough, Earth is the only planet in our solar system that hasn't been named after some Roman or Greek god.   31. Year is not always longer time period than a day. Mercury for  instance has one day on the planet twice as long as one year. This is  because Mercury rotates very slowly but revolves around the Sun in  slightly less than 88 days.   32. Our Sun may be gigantic but it still loses 360 million tonnes of material each day.   33. In case you want to be taller than the perfect profession for you is  astronaut since astronauts can be up to 2 inches taller returning from  space.This happens because the cartilage disks in the spine expand in  the absence of gravity.   34. In case you ever wonder how much does a gallon of water weighs the answer is 8.34 pounds (3.8kg).   35. Though many would say otherwise hot water freezes quicker than the cold water.   36. Albert Einstein had speech difficulties in early age.   37. Lions are excellent hunters especially when you consider that they  usually hunt in coordinated groups and stalk their chosen prey.   38. Methane is extremely potent greenhouse gas and cows are among the  largest methane emitters with each domestic cow emitting about 105  pounds of methane a year.   39. So far scientists have discovered over 20 planets outside our solar system.   40. Spacecrafts are extremely fast, with fastest one going to 40,000 mph.   41. Can you live without you head? Well if you are a cockroach you can manage somewhere around 9 days or so.   42. So how alike are humans and chimps? Well if you consider that we  share 98.4% of our DNA you could say a very lot, though on other hand we  do share 70% of our DNA with a slug.   43. Human fetuses are in fact great fans of rock music since they react  to loud rock music by kicking, or does this mean that they hate rock?   44. Average male brain is larger than average female brain (1,4 kg to 1,25 kg).   45. Humans are not the only creatures on Earth that cry, elephants are crying creatures too.   46. Polar bears would make perfect thieves since they cannot be detected by infrared cameras because of their transparent fur.   47.

World's Most Powerful Optical Microscope: Microscope Could 'Solve the Cause of Viruses'





 Previously, the standard optical microscope can only see items around one micrometre -- 0.001 millimetres -- clearly  But now, by combining an optical microscope with a transparent  microsphere, dubbed the 'microsphere nanoscope', the Manchester  researchers can see 20 times smaller -- 50 nanometres ((5 x 10-8m) --  under normal lights. This is beyond the theoretical limit of optical  microscopy.  This hugely-increased capacity means the scientists,  led by Professor Lin Li and Dr Zengbo Wang, could potentially examine  the inside of human cells, and examine live viruses for the first time  to potentially see what causes them.  The existing microscopes  which have the capacity to examine tiny items -- electron microscopes --  can only see the surface of a cell rather than examining its structure  and there is no tool to see a live virus visually.  The  scientists, from the School of Mechanical, Aerospace and Civil  Engineering, now believe they can use the microscope to detect far  smaller images in the future. The new method has no theoretical limit in  the size of feature that can be seen.  The new nano-imaging  system is based on capturing optical, near-field virtual images, which  are free from optical diffraction, and amplifying them using a  microsphere, a tiny spherical particle which is further relayed and  amplified by a standard optical microscope.  Professor Li, who  initiated and led the research in collaboration with academics at the  National University and Data Storage Institute of Singapore, believes  their research could prove to be an important development.  He  said: "This is a world record in terms of how small an optical  microscope can go by direct imaging under a light source covering the  whole range of optical spectrum.  "Not only have we been able to  see items of 50 nanometres, we believe that is just the start and we  will be able to see far smaller items.  "Theoretically, there is no limit on how small an object we will be able to see.  "The  common way of seeing tiny items presently is with an electron  microscope, and even then you cannot see inside a cell -- only the  outside. Optical fluoresce microscopes can see inside the cells  indirectly by dying them, but these dyes cannot penetrate viruses.  "Seeing  inside a cell directly without dying and seeing living viruses directly  could revolutionize the way cells are studied and allow us to examine  closely viruses and biomedicine for the first time."
