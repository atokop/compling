Waiting for revolution in Nepal: Interview with People’s Liberation Army fighter
Posted by kasama on August 24, 2011

Sabin, fighter in Nepal's Peoples Liberation Army. Photo credit: Zack
The following piece was written  from Nepal’s remote Rolpa district as part of the  Winter Has Its End revolutionary journalism team.
“During the battle, some of the Royalist Nepal Army soldiers left the camp. Some crawled into the toilets to save their own lives. That was the condition of the RNA.”
“If the revolution does not succeed, it will be very difficult for us.”
Introduction and Interview By Jim Weill
For ten years, the Maoist fighters of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) waged a guerrilla war for power starting in now-famous rural base areas in the Rolpa and Rukum districts of western Nepal. They fought first against the Armed Police in the rural countryside, and then against elements of the Royalist Nepalese Army (RNA). 
After negotiations in 2006, both major armies were regrouped in specific areas – the NA in its barracks and the PLA in new bases called “cantonments.” Over the ensuing years, the political focus of the opposing forces has been in the capital, Kathmandu, where the king had been overthrown and where different class forces put forward contrasting proposals for a new Nepal. Part of the controversy has been what to do with the two opposing armies – with reactionaries demanding the disbanding of the PLA, and the revolutionaries demanding the subordination of the NA to popular rule, and with both sides calling their opposing proposals “a process of integrating armies.”
We met Sabin, a platoon commander of the PLA, during a visit to Rachibang commune, in the Rolpa district. Sabin is also a district committee member of the Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) and is on leave from the Dahaban cantonment due to his wife’s pregnancy.

How did you become involved in the PLA?
People in Rolpa were quite oppressed and politically conscious. The government suppressed the people, so we were always in favor of revolution and destroying the monarchy. When the new party was formed by 1994, we were quite affected by its plan and the demands that the party brought. We thought this (CPN Maoist) should be the revolutionary party. I joined by 1996. Later I actually participated in the birth of the party, being involved in Young Communist League (YCL) and organizational work. At that time I was a part-timer. Then my organizational work was in the YCL and the student revolutionary front. In 2002 I became a full-timer in the PLA.
Are there any experiences you’d like to share with us about your participation in the People’s War?
Though I was not involved in so much of the war, I can remember the battle of Beni I participated in. Its purpose was to attack the police and camps of the Royal Nepalese Army (RNA). Our forces were 7,000 or 8,000 PLA members – red soldiers. We prepared to attack and received instruction and strategy for the attack from comrades in Rolpa, since it was the base area/camp.
It was a big mass march. It was such a big line that by the time that the first member of the line reached Fuliban, the last member was still here, where we are now. This was my first experience walking in such a massive march. I remember an incident in the midway. Villagers and other non-combatants were arguing over the numbers of the line. The dogs eventually grew tired of barking at us, the line was so long. We often went through the jungle, but also through some villages. It was a wonderful experience. There was no fear. There were only two options – victory or death, and we were the ones on the offensive. We had a lot of confidence that we could destroy the army camp and the police station.
The enemy also had a big force of 600-700 heavily equipped soldiers. It was the headquarters of the district of Magdi. The battle started around 9 pm, and we were able to capture 70 percent of the camp. We were planning to capture the whole barrack in 4 to 5 hours. We found a lot of good arms there and got and order not to burn the camp in order to save the weapons. But eventually we had to set fire to the camp. We started the fire from 1 am in the morning.
I remember the whole story of the fighting. We were trying to capture the camp by 1 am. We tried to burn it, but the camp was so big we were unable to burn it all. We fought all night, and in the morning, most of our bullets were gone. 30 or 40 Royal Army members were killed. The army bombed us from helicopters, and 8 to 10 of our forces were killed this way. Ultimately more than 60 people became martyrs from our side. During the battle, some of the RNA left the camp. Some crawled into the toilets to save their own lives. Such was the condition of the RNA.
We stayed until 12 pm the next day, then got the order to return. Since Beni lies near to two other district headquarters, it was very risky to stay there. While returning the commander team from the RNA tried to block our return and 7-8 PLA were killed this way. We felt quite sad after returning because we thought we would capture the camp and we walked 2-3 days without food. And many people were martyred. Though we were sad, we saw that we’d created success for the future, and saw the mistakes we had made. Lastly, we returned to the base camp in Rolpa. When we arrived, the villagers greeted us with garlands of flowers.
What happened to you after the peace agreement was signed?
It is good to change the form of the war, but by changing the form of the war, the party has been grouped in various fractions. After the peace agreement, many people from outside the party, people with light-hearted attitudes, got high-ranking positions. It is good to be a large party, but size is not the only thing. Being effective is also important.
The lifestyle of many leaders and the way they are acting after the peace agreement are making us ask – are they revolutionary? Is the peace agreement a good thing? The peace agreement is good, because the enemy has learned the old style of battle, but the things that have changed are compelling us to question things. The things that happen these days are not impressive for the cadres of the UCPN(M), but I still hope the party will be unified, go in the right way and complete the revolution. I have been from a family of martyrs and given up all of my possessions and live in this commune. If the revolution does not succeed, it will be very difficult for us.
What is the situation like in your cantonment?
It’s a hard life in the cantonment. We are not there for any jobs, but we know we are there to complete the revolution. For 11-12 months we were not given a single rupee, but today we are given 4-5000 (around $80 US ) rupees per month, which is not much. So it is a hard life.
There are two armies in Nepal, and the RNA is quite well supported by the government. They have a good life, but we have a lot of hardships and suffering in the cantonment. Being an army that has helped institute so many changes, it is unbearable for us. The bureau who is watching us is from the government. But we are still under the chain of command of the party and we are staying there. Some people are leaving the cantonment and going to the gulf countries to work. Some don’t have anything to do. So we can’t even count how many people are there in the cantonment.
To talk about the integration process, the model that has been proposed by the army is not good. But it is positive that they have proposed something at all. If we are given a bureau near the border with India, we can stop Indian encroachment. But whatever our commanders decide, we will do.

KATMANDU, Nepal — Nepal’s parliament elected the deputy leader of the former Maoist rebels as the new prime minister on Sunday, halting the Himalayan nation’s latest political crisis.
Baburam Bhattarai of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) received 340 votes in the 601-seat parliament with the backing of several smaller parties. That was more than the simple majority needed to be elected.
Bhattarai’s only opponent, Ram Chandra Poudel of the Nepali Congress party, received 235 votes.
The political crisis was triggered by former Prime Minister Jhalnath Khanal’s resignation on Aug. 14 after he failed to make process in drafting a long-delayed constitution. It had taken Khanal 17 rounds of votes in parliament over seven months to be elected in February, while Bhattarai was selected in the first attempt.
Bhattarai, 57, is the second-highest leader of the Maoist group which fought government troops until 2006 demanding political reforms and an end to the centuries-old monarchy.
Bhattarai remained in hiding during the 10 years of fighting. The bloody revolt began in mountain villages in western Nepal in 1996 but spread to most of the country by the time the rebels gave up their revolt and joined a peace process under United Nations supervision.
Bhattarai, who has a doctorate from Jawaharlal Nehru University in India, is believed to be the chief planner of the Maoists’ strategy, both during the years of fighting and in peace time.
The Maoists were able to win the largest number of the seats in 2008 parliamentary elections and now are the largest political party in the country.
Bhattarai must now form a coalition government including members of the smaller parties that supported him in Sunday’s vote. The two other major parties, Nepali Congress and the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist), have opted to stay out of the Maoist-led government.
Bhattarai’s major challenge will be to complete the peace process that began with the Maoists giving up their armed revolt. Thousands of former Maoist fighters are still confined to camps and are waiting for their future to be decided. There is disagreement among the major political parties on whether they should be integrated into the national army.
The country’s constitution also needs to be written. The Constituent Assembly elected in 2008 had two years to finish the job. That has been extended twice, and the latest deadline is Aug. 31, which is likely to be extended again.
