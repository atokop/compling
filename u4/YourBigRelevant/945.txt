Major IPCC Climate Model Prediction Error Substantiated: Ocean Warming Not Happening, It's Cooling


Read here. The climate models, based on the IPCC's favored CO2-based AGW theory, predict that oceans will warm as the atmosphere warms from human CO2 emissions. Indeed, human emissions have continued to increase over the past decade but the empirical evidence clearly shows ocean temperatures have not, with declining temperatures a recent phenomenon that may continue.
There is not a single IPCC climate prediction that foretold a decade long non-warming of Earth's oceans. In fact, the "consensus" models predicted the exact opposite. The evidence is robustly inconsistent with IPCC climate "experts" and their CO2-centric climate models.

Failure of NASA's CO2-Based Climate Model Continues: Predicted Warming Significantly Below Actual


 James Hansen, and his team at NASA, predicted significant global warming (the green curve - Scenario 'A') if human CO2 emissions continued their existing growth path. They have.
The actual warming evidence though, does not comport with NASA's climate models. Per both the GISS and HadCRUT temperature datasets, global warming (black and red curves) are at, or below, the predicted values if CO2 emissions growth had been eliminated (the aqua curve - Scenario 'C'). That has not happened, based on the evidence through July, 2011.

More Obama Green Boondoggles: GM Only Sells 302 Volts During August & 'Solar' Solyndra Goes Bankrupt


Read here and here. The Government Motors (GM) billion dollar+ electric vehicle (the Volt) is definitely not shocking the market. Obama's massive taxpayer funded EV is providing proof positive why government should not be involved in the private sector.
"It’s no longer even a real competition as the Leaf is beating the Volt more than 4 to 1. Chevy moved 302 Volts, Nissan sold 1362 Leafs. Nissan looks good by comparison to Chevy, but the number is still far short of their goal to sell half-a-million EV’s a year by 2013."
Then there has been the gawd-awful, continuous failed solar energy investments made by Team Obama. This week there came another announcement of a major taxpayer subsidized solar manufacturer being toast.
"The recent bankruptcies of solar companies Evergreen Solar and Obama extra-special-favorite Solyndra have cost taxpayers a combined $593 million. Now, the Obama  administration is in the process of guaranteeing loans for $622 million  more to new solar companies likewise destined to failure in competition  with low-cost solar panels from China."
For taxpayers, the best way to protect themselves is to 'short' any company or industry that Obama anoints with tax monies - he is a sure bet for picking losers. Hey, a loser knows losers, no? W.P.E. yet?

Hurricane Irene Wasn't: Instead, It Was A Tropical Storm That Mainstream Press Constantly Misreported


Read here. What makes a hurricane? Wind speed, plain and simple. If a storm has wind speeds below 74 MPH then it is a tropical storm not a hurricane. Irene never came close to the '74' threshold. The national media never reported the true conditions of Irene.
Gee, what a surprise that the left/liberal anti-science "journalists" would misreport the weather facts.
"So, despite looking at Irene before, during, and after both landfalls, there is no hint of a hurricane anywhere. By the time it got to New York the eye of the storm had dissipated, what was left were huge bands of rain clouds. Is there a moral in this story? Well, I can understand people taking extra precautions, better safe than sorry is a good rule. And I certainly imagine that when the Weather Service re-examines the records, the error will be corrected. But that doesn’t help in making the decisions. As soon as Irene hit land, it should have been downgraded immediately to a tropical storm. That’s what it was, not a hurricane making landfall but a tropical storm. As far as I can tell, we still haven’t had a hurricane make landfall during Obama’s presidency, a historical oddity."

Bill Nye: Liar Extraordinaire, Scientific Illiterate or Climate Change Charlatan? Or, Just An Incompetent Bozo?


Read here. Is it any wonder that the liberal/left/progressive/Democrat political spectrum is falling out of favor with the public when there are clowns like Nye, Masters, McKibben, Gore and others pushing their anti-science and anti-prosperity agendas. (These idiots continue to blindly feed and grow the political backlash to the the left and I, for one, hope they continue.)
Dr. Ryan Maue does an excellent fisking of Bill Nye's TV performance/science regarding Hurricane Irene. It's not pretty.
"But Bill Nye takes the “anti-science” crusade to a new level by showing up on Fox Business...and embarrassing the hell out of himself. Once you watch the video and read the transcript, you will be left in amazement at his utter lack of comprehension of the topic at hand on national television!...The left actually thinks Bill Nye is a brilliant ambassador for their brand of global warming alarmism — a legitimate guy that understands the science and can articulate an explanation. However, Nye has no credentials or expertise with respect to global warming and hurricanes, at all. Not one iota."

Latest EU Research Confirms That Predicted Increase In Storminess From Global Warming Has Not Occurred


Read here. The IPCC and its Climategate scientists predicted that global warming would increase the frequency and intensity of stormy weather. They based these predictions on their "expert" climate models. The prediction fails the empirical test as real world evidence confirms that storminess has not increased.
Esteves et al. studied long term datasets of weather data for the Irish Sea region going back to 1894. Their peer reviewed research found no change for storminess.
"Focusing on a well-studied and data-rich 16-km-long section of the Sefton coastline of northwest England, as they describe it, Esteves et al. used the longest available measured datasets from the eastern Irish Sea and beyond -- including tide levels, surge heights, wind speeds and wave heights -- in a search for evidence of long-term changes...say their results "show no evidence of enhanced storminess or increases in surge heights or extreme water levels," and that "the evolution of the coastline analyzed at various temporal scales shows no strong connection with metocean trends."...the available metocean data "do not indicate any statistically significant changes outside seasonal and decadal cycles.""

Global Warming Has Not Caused Predicted Marine Life Apocalypse, Instead Marine Life Enhanced Says New Study


Read here. The predictions of alarmist scientists are frequently hysterical, and most often wrong, as was globally witnessed with the Hurricane Irene forecasts. Another example of an incredibly bad "climate science" prediction was that marine life would be decimated by human-induced global warming. Scientists and empirical evidence prove that prediction wrong.
A new peer-reviewed study by Chavez et al. determined that the opposite has occurred: marine life and productivity has improved during the modern warming.
"...the three researchers -- all from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute of Moss Landing, California -- write that "general conclusions from the satellite and in situ time-series presented here are that PP [primary production] is increasing globally," and they note that global marine PP appears to have risen over the past several decades in association with multi-decadal variations in climate. In addition, they indicate that data from Continuous Plankton Recorder surveys conducted in the north Atlantic depict "increases in chlorophyll from the 1950s to the present," citing McQuartters-Gollop et al...report that ocean sediment cores containing an "undisturbed history of the past" have been analyzed for variations in PP over timescales that include the Little Ice Age...they determined that during the LIA the ocean off Peru had "low PP, diatoms and fish," but that "at the end of the LIA, this condition changed abruptly to the low subsurface oxygen, eutrophic upwelling ecosystem that today produces more fish than any region of the world's oceans...write that "in coastal environments, PP, diatoms and fish and their associated predators are predicted to decrease and the microbial food web to increase under global warming scenarios," citing Ito et al. However, they say that, "present-day trends and the sedimentary record seem to indicate that the opposite might occur."" [Francisco P. Chavez, Monique Messié, and J. Timothy Pennington 2011: Annual Review of Marine Science]

Hurricane Irene? Based On The Hype & "Expert" Predictions, This Hurricane Is Not Living Up To Its Billing


Real Science has been commenting on the actual weather conditions being reported in the midst of Hurricane Irene, and it appears this storm is not producing wind speeds that "elites" and pundits were predicting.
Below are snapshots of multiple locations in and around the hurricane's path. Images captures around 10:15am eastern time on Saturday. Clearly, the wind speeds are not living up to the monster-hype billing for this storm. (click on images to enlarge)
It now seems that total rainfall and river flooding will be the principal cause of property damage, versus damage from the lower wind speed and smaller wind-driven wave surges. (source of images)
Update: 5:30pm Saturday - Wunderground apparently removed weather station info from their Wundermaps. There may have been a tech problem that was causing wind reports to be misleading - just guessing.

Africa's Mosquito Population Declining, Malaria Cases Falling - Opposite of IPCC's "Experts" Prediction


 Read here. Image source. The UN's IPCC and world health experts predicted that global warming would grow the mosquito population and cause an increase in malaria incidence. There was no prediction by these "experts" that the mosquito population in portions of Africa would actually plummet and new malaria case numbers would shrivel. In fact, that is what has happened in Tanzania say scientists.
Researchers have found that the number of mosquitoes per insect trap has fallen from 5,000 to 14 over a 10-year period. This took place in villages with no DDT or bed nets. Some researchers think the decline is due climate change but there is no convincing evidence that would confirm that.
"But the lead author of the study...says that he is not convinced that it is just the changing climate..."It could be partly due to this chaotic rainfall, but personally I don't think it can explain such a dramatic decline in mosquitoes, to the extent we can say that the malaria mosquitoes are almost eradicated in these communities..."What we should consider is that there may be a disease among the mosquitoes, a fungi or a virus, or they're may have been some environmental changes in the communities that have resulted in a drop in the number of mosquitoes"...The research team also found anecdotal evidence that their discovery was not an isolated case..."Other scientists are saying they can't test their drugs because there are no children left with malaria.""

Massive Climate Model Failure: IPCC Models Unable To Predict Pacific Ocean Variability With Any Confidence


Read here. Scientists know that the variability of the northern Pacific has a huge impact on global climate. If IPCC climate models are ever to successfully predict future climate changes, they first need to be able to predict the variability of the northern Pacific ocean. A new study by Furtado et al. confirms what has long been suspected, the IPCC climate models are unable to deal with the Pacific ocean variability.
The North Pacific Decadal Variability (NPDV) is composed of two identified patterns of ocean variability. The first is the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the second is the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO), neither of which can be consistently predicted by the IPCC's models.
"The authors write that North Pacific Decadal Variability (NPDV) "is a key component in predictability studies of both regional and global climate change,"...they emphasize that given the links between both the PDO and the NPGO with global climate, the accurate characterization and the degree of predictability of these two modes in coupled climate models is an important "open question in climate dynamics" that needs to be addressed...report that model-derived "temporal and spatial statistics of the North Pacific Ocean modes exhibit significant discrepancies from observations in their twentieth-century climate...conclude that "for implications on future climate change, the coupled climate models show no consensus on projected future changes in frequency of either the first or second leading pattern of North Pacific SST anomalies," and they say that "the lack of a consensus in changes in either mode also affects confidence in projected changes in the overlying atmospheric circulation.""

Jeff Masters & Bill McKibben Wow Their Audiences With Exceptional Hurricane Ignorance


Read here. Hurricane scientist expert (PhD) Ryan Maue takes two climate alarmists to task for their non-scientific ramblings information regarding Hurricane Irene. Bill McKibben is your typical green leftist crackpot eccentric who is now blaming both a pipeline and President Obama for the hurricane, along with, of course, global warming.
The good news for Obama is that McKibben, the nutjob eccentric, can't blame him for past significant hurricanes that struck NYC during these years:

September 23, 1875
August 19, 1788
October 9, 1804
September 16, 1816
September 3, 1821
October 13, 1846
October 6, 1849
October 28, 1872

Jeff Masters, a meteorologist with a bent to blaming every weather event on global warming, chose to make some extreme claims about hot ocean temperatures that are...er....well, bizarre for someone with a science background.
"Masters is quoted that “bizarrely high” SSTs along Irene’s path will cause Irene to be a much wetter and apparently longer-lasting hurricane that normal.  This assertion is true if “all else is equal”.  However, before attributing the “anomalous SST” to global warming, one must control all other variables in this complex situation.  That requires considerable sensitivity research with state-of-the art numerical weather prediction (and climate) models...This hand-waving theory may not hold up when a rigorous scientific hypothesis is tested, yet McKibben does not provide a citation or reference aside from Masters’ quotations, which are not peer-reviewed in the slightest."
And of course, there is then the whole issue of "global warming" being the cause, which Masters and McKibben then conveniently ignore the actual global temperature record for the last 15 years. Looking at the real global temperatures shown in this chart, it begs the question of these two hacks exceptional human beings, "what global warming?".

The Idiocy of The NYT & The Left: Lauded Libya's Qaddafi Family As Supporter of Al Gore's Warming Crusade


Read here. (h/t Tom Nelson) The green left/liberal/progressive bias  of the mainstream press is certainly amazing, blatant and astoundingly bad. The MSM, led by the Times, will  stoop sooo low that they even will praise dictatorial tyrants because a family  member says the politically correct words about global warming.
Honestly, is it any wonder that your typical Democrat responds in  such nonsensical ways when they dedicate themsleves to the daily, holy ritual of reading garbage reporting of the NY Times like this:
"“Climate change is a global problem, but global solutions start with local solutions,” he said in faintly accented English. Societies, he said, should be built in a way that allowed them to reduce greenhouse gases. “The day will come when oil will run out, and if we wait for that it will be too late,” he said. The man — part scholar, part monk, part model, part policy wonk — was Saif al-Islam el-Qaddafi, the powerful 33-year-old son of Libya’s extroverted and impulsive president, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi.""

Mainstream Greens Plot To Destroy An Entire Industry? Greater Unemployment of The Highly Skilled Expected


Read here. Mainstream left/progressive politicians, influenced by radical green organizations, are set to destroy the iconic and famous wood ship building industry in Tasmania. The industry is based on unique 400-year old wood from forests. The amount of good quality wood needed on an annual basis is not great but the greens have managed to push through a policy that would exclude close to 100% of all logging in forests that supply this special wood.
“Details of the sham agreement are spreading far and wide and I am now being contacted by boat builders who fear Tasmania’s wooden boat building industry will be ruined...Despite the fact that 90 per cent of two key iconic species, Celery Top Pine and King Bill Pine, are already in reserves the Greens are still not satisfied...More than 70 per cent of remaining sources of these timbers are in the 430,000 hectares rubber stamped by former Wilderness Society director Jonathan West in his flimsy advice accepted by the Prime Minister and the Premier last week...The wooden boat industry has an estimated annual value of $50 million but without a timber supply it has no future."

The Completely Unhinged, Anti-CO2 Greens: "God's Wrath Caused East Coast Earthquake"


Read here. We've often noted at 'C3' that persons left-of-center have exhibited some incredibly anti-science attitudes in their approach to environmentalism, and especially the fear of CO2 emissions. Now, the Huffington Post blog empire reveals just how anti-science the mainstream left/liberal/green/Democrat has become.
Their irrational, non-scientific approach to this subject revives memories of the mainstream progressives anti-science eugenics belief that also dominated their thinking and policies.
Scary. And these are the same mainstream left-of-center minds who are now supporting Republican Jon Huntsman's bid for being the party's presidential candidate - hmmm...will Huntsman be at White House gates protesting?
"On August 29, many people of faith -- who fervently believe that God has a much better energy plan for us than the TransCanada oil company -- will go to the White House to bring God's word straight to President Obama's doorstep...What is God saying? "Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the LORD's thy God, the earth also, with all that therein is" (Deuteronomy 10:14). A contemporary translation: That oil is mine, sayeth the Lord, keep your hands off!..Having spent some time with the Lord recently, I feel there is a message for President Obama: It is God's wrath that shook the White House today. This was a 5.8 wake-up call."

Jon Huntsman To Denounce CERN Cloud Experiments As "Anti-Science" - Claims 8,000 CERN Scientists Are Wrong


Read here. Well...with the announcement of the CERN cosmic/cloud experiment results, in combination with the recent satellite measure results that confirms climate sensitivity to CO2 to be exceptionally low, the "consensus" CO2-AGW theory is now rapidly mainlining towards the mounting ash heap of consensus thinking and conventional wisdom.
The vast majority of hard-science research scientists are now coming to the belief that the climate models used by the UN's IPCC and major climate agencies are seriously in error, based on this latest research and empirical evidence. This questioning of the CO2-based climate models has recently come to the forefront in recognition that the models and climate modelers appear to have literally no skill in climate predictions, meaning that the models are in need of major revisions.
"Climate models will have to be revised, confirms CERN in supporting literature..."[I]t is clear that the treatment of aerosol formation in climate models will need to be substantially revised, since all models assume that nucleation is caused by these vapours [sulphuric acid and ammonia] and water alone."
CERN is the world's premier home of some 8,000 top-notch scientists and they are the ones who made this critically acclaimed cosmic/cloud experiment possible. As their results clearly show, the climate science is far from being "settled" and the "consensus" on AGW is non-existent.
In regard to Jon "call me crazy" Huntsman, the liberal/left/Democrat choice to be the Republican's presidential candidate, who has called AGW critics 'anti-science,' this leaves him with a major problem reflecting on his incredibly poor judgment regarding the field of climate science. If he is to maintain the moronic green/left dogma that only human CO2 causes global warming and climate change, his only course is to denounce the actual CERN climate experiments as more Republican anti-science.
Other Republican candidates should gleefully (and aggressively) point out that Huntsman is indeed 'crazy' because he refuses to accept the latest climate research and empirical evidence that proves natural forces are the primary forces driving warming and climate change, not the trace gas CO2.

The IPCC Corrupts & Compromises Climate Science Journals - A Literal Disaster For Science


Read here. The public disbelief in scientists and their science journals continues to grow. This is especially true in the realm of "climate science" and "global warming."
In the case of climate science, the UN's political agenda dictated a need to assure the appropriate peer reviewed journals lost their scientific objectivity. What better way to do it then making the "science" journals an integral part of the IPCC "science" process?
"But what happens when the people who are in charge of these journals are the same ones who write IPCC reports?...Today’s exhibit is the Journal of Climate. It’s published by the American Meteorological Society – which certainly sounds reputable. But let’s take a look at its IPCC connections...It’s chief editor, Anthony J. Broccoli, was a contributing author and expert reviewer for the IPCC’s 2007 report...Nathan Gillett, one of its editors, served in four separate AR4 capacities – as a lead author, an expert reviewer for both Working Group 1 and Working Group 2, and as an expert reviewer of the Synthesis Report. He is now a lead author for the upcoming IPCC report...Marika Holland, another editor at the Journal of Climate, contributed to two chapters of the 2007 climate bible...Editor Andrew Pitman was an IPCC lead author, a contributing author, and an expert reviewer for the 2007 edition. Moreover, he’s involved in the upcoming report as a review editor...As editor James Renwick’s bio page makes clear, he was a contributing author to the 2001 IPCC report, a lead author for the 2007 report, and is currently a lead author for AR5...editor Brian Soden was a 2007 contributing author and an expert reviewer who is currently serving as an AR5 lead author...Editor Shang-Ping Xie is currently an AR5 lead author, and editor Michael Alexander was a 2007 IPCC expert reviewer."
And that's just one of the supposed "impartial" and "objective" peer reviewed journals. As they say..."Houston, we have a problem." It's science journalism at its worst.

Government Motors (GM) 'Volt' Not Doing So Well; Nor Are The Taxpayers Being Raped By GM


Read here. Why is GM producing an ultra-expensive electric vehicle (an engineering marvel) that lacks a big market and is essentially a sales flop? Did we say massive taxpayer subsidies that guarantee profits for GM, yet?
Thanks, Obama! Just what the average American needs during an economic depression - a green "Edsel" by GM.
"This is so obvious that you’d think it might have also occurred to the people running GM. It probably did – but the reason it doesn’t matter to them is that the Volt (like the Tesla) is a taxpayer-funded money machine for GM. Even if they never sell enough cars to make an honest profit, there’s already been a huge profit to GM in the form of massive federal subsidies and of course, the massive bailout of GM itself back in 2008...Why not throw money at the electric car boondoggle? After all, it’s not GM’s money...we have a billion-dollar electric car boondoggle. And not only won’t they (GM and Tesla) take the hint and quit, they’ll keep at it – demanding more tax dollars, more subsidies, more rebates to “encourage” sales of these otherwise unsalable electric Edsels."

Modern Storm Activity Is Near A Low Point for The Last 2,220 Years Scientists Establish


Read here. The IPCC and associated Climategate scientists have claimed that human-induced global warming was producing unprecedented storm activity, with greater frequency and intensity. Using the geological activity of the Outer Banks barrier islands, Mallinson et al. was able to determine that storm activity over the last 100 years was actually less than that of both the Medieval Warming Period and the Little Ice Age - ergo, the claim that storm activity is unprecedented is false.
"The authors write that "the Outer Banks barrier islands of North Carolina, USA, contain a geologic record of inlet activity that extends from ca. 2200 cal yr BP to the present," which they say "can be used as a proxy for storm activity."...five U.S. researchers say their comparisons suggest that "the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and Little Ice Age (LIA) were both characterized by elevated storm conditions as indicated by much greater inlet activity relative to today," and they say that "given present understanding of atmospheric circulation patterns and sea-surface temperatures during the MWP and LIA, we suggest that increased inlet activity during the MWP responded to intensified hurricane impacts, while elevated inlet activity during the LIA was in response to increased nor'easter activity.""

Researchers & Ancient Clams Prove That 'Permanent' El Niño Prediction Is Wrong


Read here. Climate "scientists" pushing the human-induced global warming hysteria have predicted that modern global warming will soon change the ENSO climate pattern and all that will remain will be a permanent El Niño. The latest peer-reviewed research, however, doesn't support that prediction.
Ivany et al. analyzed fossilized clam remains from 50 million years ago that were located in the Antarctica region. The clams existed in a climate that was at least 10 degrees warmer than modern temperatures. By analyzing clam rings, the scientists were able to determine that during that significantly hotter period, the ENSO still retained its pattern of variation from El Niño to La Niña and back.
"The prevailing theory predicts that rising global temperatures could cause the ENSO to collapse, resulting in permanent El Niño conditions, which could have a major impact on socioeconomic and ecological systems worldwide..."The good news is that despite the very warm temperatures during the Eocene, the evidence from the clams and tree rings shows that the ENSO system was still active, oscillating between normal and El Niño years. That suggests that the same will be true in our future as the planet warms up again.” [Linda C. Ivany, Thomas Brey, Matthew Huber, Devin P. Buick, Bernd R Schöne 2011: Geophysical Research Letters]

New Paper Finds That Decimation of Caribou Herds Was Due To Rifles & Bullets, Not Global Warming


Read here. Climate change alarmists, many of whom write for professional climate tabloids where global warming fiction reigns, often speak to the detrimental global warming impact on species such as the polar bear and the caribou. Unfortunately for these tabloid speculators, the actual scientific research and empirical evidence is proving them wrong.
The "consensus" on the declining caribou herds of northern Canadian Territoris was that global warming was changing the local environment that was adversly impacting the herds. Yet skeptical scientists believed over hunting was the real problem. As a result, biologists pushed for hunting restrictions that were then implemented and the caribous responded: for example, one herd expanded from 32,000 to 100,000 in a just few short years.
Turns out the native idiots were slaughtering at least 20% of the herds' cows by hunting them down with GPS, snowmobiles and highpowered rifles. Not very sporting and certainly not good for maintaining a stable herd population.
"In a recently published paper, Adamczewski and three co-authors estimated the annual aboriginal harvest from the Bathurst herd alone was between 4,000 and 7,000 animals, mostly cows. Best estimates suggest that about 20 per cent of the cows were being killed every year, making it the most heavily hunted herd in the N.W.T..."They were getting hammered," Adamczewski said...But when hunting restrictions came in, the Dene could no longer take as many animals as they wanted."
As has been well established by science, the caribou have survived both warmer and colder eras, than those of modern times, since the end of the last major ice age. The key to their future survival is keeping modern aboriginals from pushing them into extinction by sheer stupidity.

New Research Determines That "Expert Consensus" About The Warming of Bering Sea Was Wrong


 Read here. Map source here. The infamous "expert consensus" that has been proven wrong on so many occasions has another climate prediction fail.
Climate scientists had claimed that sea ice coverage in the Bering Sea would shrink due to global warming and that the warmer waters would be less productive for marine life. Research by Brown et al. finds both predictions to be wrong.
"Regarded as one of the world's most productive marine environments, the Bering Sea is widely thought to be rapidly warming and losing sea ice...Results  show that, rather than declining, mean annual sea ice extent in the  Bering Sea has exhibited no significant change over the satellite sea  ice record (1979–2009). Furthermore, significant warming during the  satellite sea surface temperature record (1982–2009) is mainly limited  to the summer months...we speculate that Bering Sea primary productivity is likely to rise under conditions of future warming and sea ice loss."

The Billionaire "Global Warming" Hypocrisy: Romney Epitomizes The Essential Problem With The Mega-Rich


Read here. The mega-rich, Republican or Democrat, have a high propensity to be fantastically hypocritical about a wide variety of issues, especially those concerning the climate and the environment. The classic case is the super-rich talking about their concern about "global warming" and then proceed to walk a lifestyle that is diametrically opposed to their talk.
It's bad enough when we are lectured by the likes of super-hypocrites such as Ted Turner, Richard Branson, Oprah, Bill Gates and etc., but it becomes insufferable when a billionaire candidate for president talks about his "global warming" concerns and then blatantly acts in accordance with his internal compass that is stuck on massive material greed.
Mitt Romney is such a mega-rich presidential candidate:
"Mitt Romney is looking to quadruple the size of his $12 million California home, the San Diego Union-Tribune reports...The GOP presidential candidate has filed an application with the San Diego government to bulldoze the 3,009-square-foot beachfront house in La Jolla and replace it with a 11,062-square-foot property...In addition to the California house and a townhouse outside of Boston, which is their official primary residence, the Romneys own a $10 million vacation home on the shore of Lake Winnipesaukee in Wolfeboro, N.H."

Latest EU Satellite Sea Level Data Confirms Very Slight Increase: By 2100 Seas Will Rise By Only 3.4 Inches


Despite the claims of a handful of crank scientists, the Washington Post, and a few big government tax and spend Republicans (Romney & Huntsman), the predicted dangerous sea level increase from human-caused global warming has not taken place. In reality, the actual sea level has recently declined, which may be connected to the fact that global temperatures have been declining since 2003.




  


  




The chart on the left represents the latest EU satellite measurements (published on August 19) since 2003, which clearly shows "accelerating" sea levels to be literally bogus climate science propaganda. (click on images to enlarge)
The right chart represents the latest HadCRUT global temperatures during the same time period, along with the atmospheric CO2 levels. It's very obvious that increases of atmospheric CO2 have little, if any, impact of temperature changes. The red curve shows actual temperature cooling since 2003, which was not predicted by a single crank "expert" climate scientist.
The recent climate empirical evidence does not support the claim that global warming and climate change are of imminent danger to society. In fact, the evidence points to the potential that global warming is morphing into global cooling.
For any presidential candidate to claim that global warming exists as a danger to the world, and must be a priority to "fix," should never be allowed to set foot in the Oval Office. This country cannot afford another president who would trash the American economy and jobs because of an unsubstantiated theory and fixation that is not supported by clear, hard, brutal facts.
It's got to stop: No more presidents pushing WMD or AGW speculations/hysteria, with over-the-top catastrophic predictions that have needlessly drained the treasury, and torn the country's fabric and common objectives. We need a president who will keep the stupid and the hysterical out of the Oval Office, once and for all.

Is It "Fleeing Species" From Global Warming? Or, Is It "Fleeing Journalists" From Objective Science Reporting?


Read here. The news media this past week made a huge to-do of a new study claiming that species across the world were fleeing geographical locations due global warming. While immediately trumpeting this story as new and significant, the actual truth indicates this study is just warmed-up, leftover garbage from a previous study by the same "scientist."
If the press wasn't so adverse to doing even an internet investigation before publishing 'press release' research, they would have found the following about the previous study by this researcher:
"What no one seems to realize or remember is that things turned out  rather badly the last time [Chris D.] Thomas’ work was similarly fêted by  journalists...Nature published three separate critiques of the 2004 Thomas  paper six months afterward. These were followed by challenges in other  publications – including a 6,000-word evisceration by a conservation biologist at Oxford University...Daniel Botkin, who is described as “one of the preeminent ecologists of the 20th century” similarly lambasted the 2004 Thomas paper – both in the peer-reviewed literature as well as on his own blog. He’s called that study “the worst paper I have ever read in a major scientific journal.”
As the story indicates, again it's the blogger community that is doing the investigative reporting because the mainstream press is either to lazy and/or stupid - in essence, the MSM continues to publish climate change "science" garbage without any fact checking.

NASA Climate "Scientists" Called Out For Their Incredibly Bad Super El Niño Predictions


Read here. NASA has been the heart of this nation's global warming hysteria, with the most recent evidence being just a plainly bizarre "aliens hate global warming" study published by a NASA scientist.
Another aspect of NASA's being led by the hysterics of its "scientists" is the ongoing, incredible incompetence of their climate predictions. Besides the laughable, ludicrous NASA prediction that sea levels will rise by some 82 feet by 2100, there is the never-ending prediction of a Super El Niño that never seems to happen.
 This chart reveals just how wrong NASA has been with their current Super El Niño prediction. And why doesn't the public know how badly NASA has performed as a predictor of climate events? Because the mainstream press refuses to report actual climate empirical evidence to challenge the NASA press releases. That's why bloggers such as Bob Tisdale are so invaluable.

Govt Scientists Manufacture Climate Crisis: The "Official" Drought Is Not Really A Drought Afterall 


 Read here. This is a webcam picture of an area smack dab in the middle of a "drought crisis" that government scientists claim is happening.
The image reveals another example of the lengths to which taxpayer funded scientists will push climate change hysteria in order to protect their funding and jobs.
Everything that government climate scientists states as "truth" should really be examined for veracity. And as the reporting of global temperatures indicate, bureaucrat scientists are up to their necks in global warming fabrication and other climate corruption shenanigans.

Severe Weather In The Far East & Pacific Regions Has Declined Over The Last 50 Years, Scientists Confirm


Read here. The UN's IPCC and associated climate alarmist scientists predicted that severe weather would increase globally as a result of human-caused global warming. Three new peer reviewed studies, representing the large expanse of the Australia-Asia region, determined that cyclone and tropical storm occurrence has actually declined over modern era, post WWII.
Simple summary: The IPCC, its climate "experts" and their predictions were wrong, again.
"These three studies provide even more evidence (as if any more is even  required) that shows that claims that hurricane activity is increasing  are completely at odds with a plethora of findings reporting on  observations collected from throughout the world."

Obama's War On Americans: His EPA Strangles New Mexico's Economy With A New $370 Million Regulation 


Read here. The Obama-approved rogue EPA agency is determined to crush any economic activity in the name of inconsequential benefit if coal is involved. In the most recent case case, the EPA is mandating that a New Mexican power facility install a $370 million retrofit that will not make any significant difference in the air quality - basically, a waste of money.
Needless to say, the war on average Americans and the economy by Obama's regulators continues. (Time to defund the EPA?)
"Despite comporting with both federal guidelines and state law, these controls weren’t good enough for the EPA...Whatever its rationale, [on August 5th] the EPA imposed Regional Haze retrofits at San Juan that would cost New Mexico ratepayers $370 million – a nearly tenfold increase over those approved by New Mexico officials...Based on peer-reviewed research, there is a 35 percent chance that the visibility “benefit” of the EPA’s preferred controls could be perceptible by the general population on the seventh-worst visibility day of the year at Mesa Verde, the national park closest to the San Juan Generating Station...In other words, most people won’t even notice the difference wrought by the EPA’s ultra-expensive controls."

NY Times On Green Jobs: "But the results so far suggest such numbers are a pipe dream"


Read here. The notoriety of Obama's and the Democrat's green job fiasco is finally being picked up by the leading pulpit of green-leftism in the U.S. - the New York Times. The gullibility and idiocy represented by the article brings a certain level of schadenfreude as greenie/leftie/liberal cope with the obvious, yet continue to pursue a failed strategy they do excel at: wasting taxpayer monies.
"In the Bay Area as in much of the country, the green economy is not  proving to be the job-creation engine that many politicians envisioned.  President Obama once pledged to create five million green jobs over 10  years. Gov. Jerry Brown promised 500,000 clean-technology jobs statewide  by the end of the decade."
Rather than adding jobs, the study found, the sector actually lost 492  positions from 2003 to 2010 in the South Bay, where the unemployment  rate in June was 10.5 percent.
Federal and state efforts to stimulate creation of green jobs have largely failed, government records show.
Job training programs intended for the clean economy have also failed to  generate big numbers...$59 million in state, federal and private money dedicated to green jobs  training and apprenticeship has led to only 719 job placements — the  equivalent of an $82,000 subsidy for each one."

Think You Can Avoid Gas Tax By Driving an Elec. Auto? Think Again. Top Democrats Want New Tax On Miles Driven


Read here. The Democrat spendthrifts in Congress need money, a lot of it. And as more and more people travel on bike, moped, electric cars and hybrids the DemoSpends have less tax money to play with. Thus, they are now considering a new mile-driven-tax to penalize those who were encouraged to go 'green.'
"Sen. Kent Conrad (D.-N.D.), chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, is  expected to make a recommendation later this year on whether the federal  government should drop the gas tax and implement the Vehicle Miles  Traveled (VMT) tax...By requiring cars to be equipped with odometer spyware that will report  to authorities how many miles are driven, government is looking to toss  out the old gas tax for a new miles-driven fee...“The Left is  always pushing for more and more regulations, and more and more taxes.   Now an insatiable Washington is looking to tax so-called green vehicles  in a Big Brotheresque way,”"

"Peak Solar" Strikes States - Solar Power Makes No Economic Sense Without State Subsidies


Read here. With U.S. state budgets under tremendous pressure to balance budgets, many are cutting expenses, including those lucrative subsidies for solar installations. Now that solar subsidies have been reduced or eliminated, solar home and business installations rarely make viable economic sense.
Tennessee and Oregon are two recent states that are pulling the plug on solar.
""While  the state has put great emphasis on solar technology in recent  years,  bringing that technology to bear in Tennessee homes and  businesses is  proving a difficult task because of the high cost of  installation,  which is becoming increasingly hard for the state and its  citizens to  swallow. Wednesday, the Tennessee Solar Institute announced it would stop  processing applications for further grants as  it exhausts about $10  million of stimulus funds encouraging businesses  to invest in solar  technology."......""Without the tax credits, the economics of commercial solar projects   don't work, for electricity buyers or investors who underwrite the   projects.""

The China Problem: Renewable Energy & Green Technology At Mercy of 'Rare Earth' Prices


Read here and here. The problem of rare earth supply is one even shared by China's own wind turbine manufacturers. The prices have risen so sharply that production of high demand wind turbines has to be curtailed to the detriment of Chinese producers and international turbine customers.
With the massive government subsidization of renewable energy projects, the supply of rare earth production has tightened, and has become especially acute since China production represents 95% of the world's supply. Despite this known death grip on supply, the Obama administration and other western countries have done little to solve the China problem.
"The result, according to US analysts, is that the rest of the world has sleepwalked into the parlous situation it now finds itself in. 'We all know the ball has been dropped in this [rare earths] space and not only by the US but by a whole swath of Western economies,'...The GAO report estimated it could take 15 years for the West to catch up with China and develop alternative supplies...a senior metallurgist at the US Department of Energy's Ames Laboratory, has been studying rare-earth materials since the 1960s. 'There is nearly zero rare-earths mining, processing and research going on now in the US,'...Officials in the US, Japan and Europe are now debating whether to lodge a complaint with the World Trade Organisation over China's export quotas on rare earths. Their concern is that China will have an unfair price advantage as it builds up a green-tech industry that it wants to export all over the world."

Obama Plans To Loan $500 Million For Solar Project - In India


Read here. Investing in an Indian solar project is not what most Americans would think to be a good and appropriate use of American financing during difficult economic times. For a president that constantly talks about creating new jobs for Americans, he certainly doesn't 'walk the talk' unless it's in another country.
"The $500 million in new loans will come on top of $75 million in  financing that the Export-Import Bank has already provided this year for  solar power projects in India...“In fiscal year 2011 to date, the Bank has approved financing  totaling approximately $75 million for four solar projects in India,”  the bank said...“The Bank also has about $500 million of India solar projects in the  pipeline that will generate an estimated 315 MW of solar power.”...While in India last month, Export-Import Bank Chairman Fred Hochberg,  an Obama appointee, announced two of the new solar projects the  U.S.-government bank will be financing."
Amazingly, this is not the only non-U.S. energy project this president has supported. Instead of helping American companies drill for oil in our own backyard, he instead provided direct help for development of the Brazilian oil fields, which the oil will then be sold to China. Figures.
Hmmm.....I wonder. If he were to aggressively help U.S. oil, natural gas and coal companies to extract our mineral wealth for either internal or overseas sales, would that increase jobs in America? Just asking.

Obama Pours Taxpayer Dollars Into Solar, Up 626% - Payback Is Loss of Jobs & Bankrupt Companies


Read here. Obama and his team think they can pick green energy technology winners. They have increased the subsidies to solar companies by 626% while trying to reduce subsidies to fossil fuels.
"President Barack Obama wants to end  subsidies that go to oil and  natural gas companies, a new Department of  Energy report shows that  federal subsidies to clean energy are way up,  with solar seeing a  subsidy increase of 626 percent...Obama repeated his call to end subsidies to oil and  gas companies and said that  “instead of subsidizing yesterday’s energy,  we should invest in  tomorrow’s,” adding that “clean energy can lead to  new jobs and new  businesses,” and “[a]n investment in clean energy today  is an  investment in a better tomorrow.”"
But those solar investments are going south, losing the taxpayer monies in the process as we discussed here and here. Obama and the Federal government need to remove themselves from the energy market, which subsidies and regulation have turned into a dysfunctional sector of the economy.

Earth To Jon Huntsman: Global Warming Is Not "Global" Nor Is It "Warming"


Read here. (h/t Tom Nelson) Let's face it, the American people are ready for a presidential candidate who demonstrates a strong appreciation for the empirical facts and who is not going to be bamboozled by the media elites nor the taxpayer funded, entrenched bureaucrats on major policy issues.
Jon Huntsman is not that presidential candidate as he is unwilling to accept the actual empirical evidence on global warming. As a result, he will not stop the EPA policy of destroying American competitiveness with their big government, anti-CO2 jihad.
Don't believe that? Hey, let's review the real Jon Huntsman, in all his faded likeness of Obama.
“"We’re not going to win a national election if we become the anti-science party,” John Weaver, Huntsman’s chief strategist, said in an interview Wednesday. “The American people are looking for someone who lives in reality and is a truth teller because that’s the only way that the significant problems this country faces can be solved."
Jon Huntsman believes global warming is "global" whereas the empirical evidence is conclusive: there is no global warming, it's regional in nature, and the lack of warming in the U.S. over the last 15 years is a clear example of that. Helloooo....Americans aren't burning up over this cooling trend, Mr. Huntsman. (see below chart)

Jon Huntsman believes that warming is a result of human CO2 emissions and that the globe is endangered, necessitating U.S. economic suicide to save Gaia. But wait, uh oh, it seems not even the world has warmed in the last 15 years; and, another uh oh, it looks like levels of CO2 have no relationship with temperature changes. Damn those pesky empirical facts. (see below chart)
  Jon Huntsman believes the bureaucrat scientists on the public dole, who are saying and doing everything (including fabricating data) to protect their incredible global warming gravy train. In contrast, the American people don't believe the global warming exaggerations and hysteria from these same scientists. Why? Because it's obvious these "scientists" have a definite conflict in interest that pushes them to conveniently ignore or dismiss away the actual empirical evidence. It's understandable for the bureaucrats - it's simply money and job security vs. honest science. And we all know which way the bureaucrat it going to tilt with that choice.
  Jon Huntsman is just another Obama. As in, the facts are ignored. The "experts" are believed. The voters desires are unheeded. And voila, what did we get? We got a socialist, government-run ObamaCare jammed down our throats, which Americans did not want.
Now we have Jon Huntsman ignoring the climate facts. He believes the Climategate "experts." And he will definitely not do what the voters want. He instead will allow the EPA to aggressively pursue the draconian CO2 policies to the detriment of the U.S. and its citizens.
Jon Huntsman is Obama II. That's why he has such little Republican support and why the coastal liberals/Democrats love him. In the real world though, the American people are saying no more Obamas - enough of the elites' incompetence and left/green ideology of the coastal anti-science crowd.

UK Riots Caused By Global Warming Alarmists: Youth Depressed & Despondent From AGW Hysteria


Read here. (h/t Tom Nelson) The green hysteria movement led by such shrill and depressing personalities as Al Gore, Joe Romm and Bill McKibben would make any young person feel pathologically hopeless, irritably moody and very angry. And as prisoners of government run education propaganda institutions these young people get a double, and sometimes triple, dose of daily hysteria about the world dying off because of global warming. The end result?
A young generation that doesn't give a crap since life will soon end for them because almost certainly Gaia is going to kill them off at a early age - as they were made to believe. With that attitude instilled by the lunatic greens, is it any wonder that they go off and riot against the establishment?
Maybe it's time to start holding each and every green organization legally responsible for the needless hysteria and over-the-top fearmongering they publish and proselytize, no?
"Got kids? Watched as they've been indoctrinated - sorry, I mean  educated - about global warming over the last decade? Then you'll know  what I mean. They come home from school moodily depressed about the  future of our planet and, of course, what that means for their own  lives. What's the point? We're all doomed! Why study? Why bother getting  an education? It's futile. Sea levels are rising. Temperatures are  soaring. Soon we'll all be living in a polluted hell-hole constantly  battling the equivalent of the Queensland floods or the Victorian  bushfires year upon year. And you want me to waste what precious time I  have left studying accountancy?...It's called nihilism, and it's  even more terrifying to witness in your teenage children than hickeys,  drunkenness, truancy, insolence, idleness, bad marks or bullying.  Nihilism, or the conviction that life on Earth is totally pointless,  saps the young of their energy, their ambition, and their will to  strive, struggle and triumph."

Why The Obama Admin. Should Quit Subsidizing Wealthy Investors For Wind Turbines - A Visual Explanation


Read here. In essence, wind turbine farms are a terrible investment when it comes to producing energy when it is actually needed. Wind power does not help the country to become energy "independent."
When demand peaks (the green curve), the wind energy delivered hits bottom (the blue curve).
Recognizing that wind farms are not the source of reliable energy when actually needed (see chart) would allow politicians to quit wasting huge subsidies on crony capitalists and wealthy investors.

CAGW On Ropes: Robust Confirmation That Climate Sensitivity Is Significantly Lower Than IPCC Guesstimates


Read here and here. Catastrophic anthropogenic global warming (CAGW), which theoretically causes climate/weather disasters, relies solely on the climate being highly sensitive to CO2 atmospheric levels. For global warming to reach the predicted IPCC's "catastrophic" global warming of at least 3°C infers that a doubling of CO2 levels is required - a high climate sensitivity guesstimate by the IPCC modellers. But does this guesstimate reflect observational reality?
The simple answer is 'No.' The key sensitivity guesstimate and predicted warming fail empirical scrutiny.
A new study by the MIT climate research area confirms that the climate sensitivity guesstimate is significantly too high per the real world empirical evidence. Instead, the actual climate sensitivity based on empirical measurements is approximately 0.7°C per doubling of CO2 levels, which will not lead to any of the claimed climate disruption and/or weather disasters that alarmists rely on to frighten policymakers.
This new scientific finding helps explain why the climate models have been such miserable failures regarding global warming predictions, as noted by these charts:

Researchers Determine Climate Model Prediction Wrong: Human CO2 Does Not Enhance El Niños


Read here. Computer programmers purposefully coded the climate model simulations to produce ENSO events that increased both in frequency and intensity, with stronger El Niños leading to more severe weather results. This was done in the belief that human CO2-induced global warming would produce such results. Unfortunately for the IPCC and its climate modelers, these simulated climate predictions were wrong.
The scientists who developed the Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI) refined and expanded their research to extend the MEI capabilities back to the 1870s. By doing so, they were able to analyze earlier ENSO events as compared to those of the modern era. Their work confirmed that today's El Niños and La Niñas are no different than those of a hundred years ago.
"...the two U.S. researchers describe their efforts "to boil the MEI concept down to its most essential components to enable historical analyses that more than double its period of record,"... "designed to help...differentiate between 'natural' ENSO behavior in all its rich facets, and the 'Brave New World' of this phenomenon under evolving greenhouse gas-related climate conditions.""...report that "the new MEI.ext confirms that ENSO activity went through a lull in the early- to mid-20th century, but was just about as prevalent one century ago as in recent decades." In fact, they state that "so far, none of the behavior of recent ENSO events appears unprecedented, including duration, onset timing, and spacing in the last few decades compared to a full century before then"...So far, there is no indication of the "fingerprint of man" in any aspect of ENSO behavior over the last few decades..."

Democrat's Green Job Scam: Obama Spends $20 Million For 14 New "Green" Jobs


Read here. (h/t Tom Nelson) In the realm of you-can't-make-this-stuff-up, more living proof, this time from Seattle, that the economic stimulus from "green jobs" is a con job that just about every skeptic pointed out. Yet, the mainstream press and your typical liberal/progressive/Democrat actually still believe in the green job fantasy.
This is a classic example of why taxes should be lowered and spending cut. If you provide too much tax money to politicians and entrenched bureaucracies, the money wasted on worthless programs grows exponentially.
"As of last week, only three homes had been retrofitted and just 14 new jobs have emerged from the program. Many of the jobs are administrative, and not the entry-level pathways once dreamed of for low-income workers. Some people wonder if the original goals are now achievable..."The jobs haven't surfaced yet," said director of Got Green, a community organizing group focused on the environment and social justice..."Who's benefiting from this program right now – it doesn't square with what the aspiration was..."I think what it boils down to is who's got the money.""

Scientists Confirm That "Settled" Science Prediction About A Greenhouse Gas Proves To Be Robustly Wrong 


Read here. Honestly, sometimes the debunking of climate "settled" science feels like shooting fish in a barrel. As we have discussed often at 'C3', most of the IPCC climate predictions have proven to be wrong - certainly, one can fairly conclude that actual climate science is very unsettled at this point in time.
With that said, another debunking of an IPCC prediction has been confirmed.
Recent research by Aydin et al. established, without reservation, that methane gases had not increased as predicted by the AGW hypothesis and the UN's IPCC Climategate scientists were promulgating. In essence, the infamous "methane" tipping point is another failed climate model prognostication.
This team of researchers spent tax payer monies to speculate what happened to the IPCC's methane and, of course, to make an implied plea for more funds to investigate further. Did we say "unsettled" yet?
"Recent data from NSF-funded research in both Greenland and Antarctica demonstrate that fossil-fuel related emissions of both methane and ethane, two of the most abundant hydrocarbons in the atmosphere, declined at the end of the twentieth century...causes of the decline in methane emission rates to the atmosphere have been puzzling scientists for some time. This new study shows that a change in human activities may have played a key role in the recent leveling off of methane, which, being a potent greenhouse gas contributes to global temperatures..." 
"We still have more research to conduct, but this discovery is significant... We must work together to continue to find ways to further our research on this very important subject." [Murat Aydin, Kristal R. Verhulst, Eric S. Saltzman, Mark O. Battle, Stephen A. Montzka, Donald R. Blake, Qi Tang, Michael J. Prather 2011: Nature]

Sea Urchin Babies Unharmed By Mean Old Ocean Acidification, Peer-Reviewed Study Finds


Read here. The left/green coalition has conjured up the boogieman termed "ocean acidification" to instill fear in the hearts of liberal/progressives "elites" that marine life will be adversely affected by greater emissions of human CO2. Based on the ocean acidification fears, Yu et al. conducted research on sea urchin babies larvae immersed in water with lower values of pH to determine its impact on larvae growth and well being.
The research found that sea urchin larvae were not impacted by levels of increasing "acidification" of sea water that some have predicted will represent ocean waters 100+ years from now.
"Yu et al. state that "the observed developmental progression and survival of cultures was within the norm typically observed for this species at this temperature range." In addition, they indicate that "a lack of developmental deformities at early stages for pCO2 ~1000 ppm has been previously reported for this species..." And they say "there are even reports that survival is increased in this species and its congener S. droebachiensis under some low pH conditions..."...conclude, that "the effects of small magnitude in these urchin larvae are indicative of a potential resilience to near-future levels of ocean acidification."" [Pauline C. Yua,  Paul G. Matsona, Todd R. Martzb, Gretchen E. Hofmanna 2011: Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology]
Note: Yes, indeed we know larvae are not 'babies' and we also know that polar bears are not 'cuddly' as the greens like to portray.

Major "Consensus" Prediction Fail: An African Eco-Climate Changes For The Better Due To Global Warming


Read here. The African region known as the Sahel lies just south of the Sahara, from the Atlantic coast to the Red Sea. The climate experts had predicted that this region of Africa would be come more arid, with a greater frequency of droughts due to global warming making it an unlivable area. That has not happened. The consensus of climate experts was wrong.
Instead, the Sahel has received more rainfall, and vegetation is growing in areas that were previously rock and sand. The greening has become so well established that agriculture has once again become viable.
"The United Nations’ Africa Report of 2008 confirmed that the greening of the Sahel is now well established and that increases in rainfall are the main driver of the change in the vegetation cover. The report noted that there was a 50% increase in vegetation in parts of Mali, Mauritania and Chad during 1982-2003. Vegetation changes play a significant role in the rainfall variability.  The increase in rainfall has allowed more plants to grow, which in turn increases precipitation even more. Plants transfer moisture from the soil into the air by evaporation from their leaves and hold water in the soil close to the surface, where it can also evaporate. The darker surface of plants compared with sand also absorb more solar radiation, which can create convection and turbulence in the atmosphere which might create rainfall. Vegetation effects account for around 30 percent of annual rainfall variation in the Sahel. The increased vegetation will fix the soil, enhance its anti-wind-erosion ability, reduce the possibility of released dust and consequently cause a decline in the numbers of sand-dust storms."

More News On The 'Green Job' Scam That Politicians Have Wasted Tax Payer Monies On


Read here. Evergreen Solar a subsidized concern that closed its plant and cut 800 jobs has now filed for bankruptcy. Before doing so, they moved their plant to China.
From 2008, at the genesis of the Obama 'green job' scam:
""Thanks to the dedication and collaboration of AeonSolar, Evergreen Solar, PV Powered,  IBEW, Turner Construction and the DNCC, we have been able to provide  clean, renewable solar power to the Pepsi Center and raise awareness on  renewable sources of energy to those attending the Democratic National  Convention,” said Andrea Robinson, Director of Sustainability &  Greening, Democratic National Convention Committee."
