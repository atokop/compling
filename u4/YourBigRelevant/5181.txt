A rare 5.9-magnitude earthquake has struck the east coast of United States, shaking some of the country's largest cities. The US geological survey said the quake occurred in central Virginia, about 165km south of the capital, Washington DC, and was the most severe quake in the area in more than a century. In Washington DC, the White House, the Pentagon and the US Capitol were all evacuated. The tremor has affected flights, trains and phone services across the US, while a nuclear reactor was shut down.

May 17, 2011, 2:05 pm buddyhuggins.blogspot.com en.wikipedia.org Morganza Spillway will divert Mississippi River Forever? EARTHQUAKE NUCLEAR BLACKMAIL Proof the Shadow Government is intending to create A Huge Disaster in the US For two years before the Japan disaster, Benjamin Fulford was on record saying the Powers that Were had planned to attack Japan with an earthquake weapon -- and set off the nuclear reactors. This is a matter of public certainty, as he announced these plans in two different videos as well as in numerous updates. This is the main reason why the Internet exploded with articles about HAARP in the aftermath of the Japan disaster. These same negative groups are now apparently trying to set off the New Madrid Fault, which runs parallel with the Mississippi River -- as there are some fifteen different nuclear reactors along the fault line. Apparently the floods are a precursor to this -- in an attempt to lubricate the fault line and increase the likelihood of it happening. I believe this is all happening now because these groups are very, very close to defeat -- and are using this as a final attempt to blackmail and coerce the rest of the world into backing off of the attack. The defeat has been going on for some time -- and I am now releasing an interview I did with Fulford last November that goes into detail about how the global community is ganging up on the "Old World Order" and demanding they stand down. I DO NOT THINK THIS WILL WORK -- BUT WE ARE NOT <b>...</b>

CNN Article: www.cnn.com (CNN) -- Tuesday's Virginia earthquake triggered the shutdown of a nearby nuclear power plant and spurred declarations of "unusual events" at plants as far away as Michigan, US authorities reported. Dominion Virginia Power said both reactors at its North Anna plant, less than 20 miles from the epicenter of the magnitude-5.8 quake, shut down after the first tremors. Amanda Reidelbach, an emergency management spokeswoman for Louisa County, said the plant vented steam, but there was no release of radioactive material. David Heacock, the utility's chief nuclear officer, said the plant was operating on emergency power and the units were safely deactivated. "The plants are designed for this kind of a seismic event," Heacock said. "There is no apparent damage to anything at the plant right now." Heacock said the plant had four diesel generators supplying backup power and that those generators had three days of fuel. However, off-site electric power was expected to be restored later Tuesday, he said. Dominion Virginia said reactors at its other nuclear station, the Surry plant near Newport News, were still running. The North Anna plant is about 50 miles northwest of Richmond and about 90 miles southwest of Washington. Operators declared an alert -- the second-lowest level of emergency reporting under US nuclear regulations -- after the quake struck shortly before 2 pm, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said. Twelve other plants in six states issued an <b>...</b>

RIP to those who died. Tsunami Alert for New Zealand, the Philippines, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Hawaii, and others. Waves expected over the next few hours, caused by 8.9 earthquake in Japan. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (Reuters) - The biggest earthquake on record to hit Japan rocked the northeast coast on Friday, triggering a 10-meter tsunami that killed hundreds of people and swept away everything in its path, including houses, ships and cars. The Red Cross in Geneva said the wall of water was higher than some Pacific islands and a tsunami warning was issued for almost the entire Pacific basin, although alerts were lifted for some countries, including Taiwan, Australia and New Zealand. Up to 300 bodies were found in the coastal city of Sendai, media said. NHK television said the victims appeared to have drowned. The extent of the destruction along a lengthy stretch of coastline suggested the death toll could rise significantly. Some 3000 residents living near a nuclear plant in Fukushima prefecture, north of Tokyo, were told to evacuate but the government said no radiation was leaking. It said the evacuation was a precaution after a reactor cooling malfunction. Other nuclear power plants and oil refineries were shut down after the 8.9 magnitude quake, while one refinery was ablaze. A major explosion hit a petrochemical complex in Miyagi prefecture after the quake, Kyodo said. Political leaders <b>...</b>

One day, a group of wushu athletes were searching for a location to train. They stumbled across what they thought was an empty warehouse and laid claim to it, thinking it would be a perfect place for practice. Little did they know that beneath their feet and a mile of reinforced concrete was a government laboratory, conducting advanced radiation experiments in pursuit of a new weapon. The wushu-ers continued practice in their new haven, but below them, the laboratory had turned into hell. The last transmission that headquarters in DC received from the lab showed a group of soldiers bearing no colors or standards slaughtering the helpless scientists. The soldiers took equipment, computers, and documents. All had left but one, who approached the center of the lab's research- a portable nuclear reactor. Punching in a code on the control panel, he increased the reactor power to 200% above capacity. Turning towards the camera, he waved goodbye and left the lab. Above, practice was in full swing. They had all gone through full sets, but the excitement of finding such a perfect room for training spurred them to continue on, oblivious to the imminent disaster. But below them, one scientist clinging to life had managed to reach the computer, and slowly inputted a series of commands as the warning alarms screamed in his ears. Unable to abort the reactor's overload, he could only activate the lab's counter measure: a series of exhaust shafts designed to disperse the explosion <b>...</b>

What's Cooking with Natural Gas? - Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming - 2008-07-30 - The Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming held a hearing on what role natural gas can play in a climate-friendly energy future on Wednesday July 30, 2008. Natural gas plays a critical role in numerous sectors of our economy from home heating to chemical production to electricity generation to transportation fuel. With 3.4 percent of global natural gas reserves, the United States has the fifth largest reserves in the world. Since a low in 1986, domestic consumption of natural gas has generally increased and its uses have broadened. Natural gas has especially become popular as a cleaner alternative to coal in the electrical utility sector and gasoline and diesel in the transportation sector. As Congress considers energy policies that will increase our energy independence and help solve global warming, understanding the role of natural gas in our economy and how it might contribute to energy policies is critical. WITNESS LIST: Aubrey McClendon, CEO, Chesapeake Energy; Clay Harris, CEO, Suez LNG North America; David Manning, Executive VP, National Grid; Rich Wells, Vice President Energy, The Dow Chemical Company; John German, Manager Environmental and Energy Analysis, American Honda; Mark Smith, Executive Director, Independent Petroleum Association of Mountain States.
