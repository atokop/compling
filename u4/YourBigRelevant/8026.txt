@Tachin1994 despite the relatively low scale of the earthquake, it did strech﻿ from Georgia to Toronto, Canada, those 2 being very far apart and all, so really what im saying it had that earthquake been as strong as the one you guys had in Chile, then there would be catastrophic damage that would have been pretty much unheard of

@Tachin1994 I﻿ still don't get it. Why does everybody uses japan or Haiti as examples. We here at chile had an earthquake jus as strong, but nobody cared, but when 33 miners got caught on the mine, everybody was like "Oh look, poor country, this is the first tragedy they've ever had" god you North americans are ignorants. 3 of you arrived to my country and when we asked them about the world map, They thought that mexico, canada were in another continent, and that they were all north america.

Sure, huuuuuuge... dude, in my country (chile) we had a 8.9 earthquake and﻿ nobody payed us attention. Almost 2000 people died. After that, a 6.5 earthquake was like "sooo... what's the matter..." u noob Gringos, you don`t know what a cataclysm is, but anyway, you feel like victims and say "Oh no, we all were about to die, but now we are heroes... yay!" assholes.

@Tachin1994 even a 5.0 can have a catastrophic outcome if it happens very close to the surface. A 5.1 happened this year in﻿ Spain, for example, killing at least 10 people. If you go to emsc-csem . org, photos section, you can see some of the damage and victims lying on the ground or beneath the rubble.

@acitalianman13 yes indeed, east/central isn't as seismic as west... just saying that up to 7.0, these are considered just tremors.
If US and NZ suffered that damage with 6.0 "tremors", just wait to see how it feels struck by an 8.8, for 3 minutes... sadly japan wasn't as "lucky" as us.﻿
