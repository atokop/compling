A magnitude 5.8 earthquake hit just outside Richmond, Va. today, causing little damage, but sending Twitter into a frenzy.
The epicenter, which was located in Mineral County, Va., fell between Richmond and Charlottesville, south of the nation's capital. According to the USGS, the quake occurred at a depth of 3.7 miles.
Moments during and after the tremors were felt along the East Coast, social media users took to Twitter to type their reactions on the earthquake. Some East Coasters were shocked their buildings were shaking, and others made light of the tremors, blaming them on current events such as Will and Jada's recently rumored split.
You can see some of the best reactions for yourself, below.

				So let me get this straight if a natural disaster or occurrence happens to another part of the country or world that it rarely ever happens in we can't be upset about it? There hasn't been a sizable earthquake here (Northern VA) since 1897 and SOME west coasters think we should brush it off because they get them all the time. Well how about this California if 22 inches of snow dumped in Los Angeles tomorrow us east coasters don't want to hear a peep out of you because we get 100 inches of snow every winter. Or if a hurricane hits Chicago people in Florida can laugh at them? 
A 5.8 earthquake is frightenin­g especially when the people that live here aren't prepared and we don't have buildings that are used to taking hits like this. Well what am I saying, you might as well laugh now buy cry later because God forbid if you get wiped off the face of the map by an earthquake worthy of cringing by California­n standards. 

Sorry that last line is harsh but making fun of situations where there could have been potentiall­y hundreds of deaths from falling debris is pretty harsh too.
