Virginia Earthquake: Foreshock of a Larger Quake That’s Coming?   August 24, 2011 by Kristen    Filed under Commentary   1 Comment    A Large earthquake hit Virginia today and tremors were felt up the East coast as far as Canada. There is a possibility it may be a foreshock of a larger quake that is coming. I sure hope not, but I thought I would share this with you just in case.http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/recenteqsww/Quakes/usc0005ild.htmlhttp://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/recenteqsus/Maps/US10/32.42.-85.-75.phphttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/8718957/Pentagon-e…http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/24/us/24quake.htmlhttp://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/story/2011/08/23/quake-virginia.htmlNuclear plant loses power:http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903461304576526642400085456.htm…NLE11:http://www.ccdem.net/home/nle11USGS warns VA quake could be a foreshock:http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/202683/20110823/virginia-earthquake-5-8-richm…   Share and Enjoy:  Tags:          Comments One Response to “Virginia Earthquake: Foreshock of a Larger Quake That’s Coming?”       Trackbacks Check out what others are saying about this post...
