A 3.4-magnitude earthquake rattled Mineral, Virginia, early Thursday, nine days after a 5.8-magnitude temblor in the same area shook up much of the eastern United States.
Thursday's quake, which struck at 5:09 a.m., was centered four miles south-southeast of Mineral at a depth of about three miles, according to preliminary data from the U.S. Geological Survey.

For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places; there will be famines. These are but the beginning of the birth pains.

4.2 earthquake in LA less than 30 minutes ago. Where's the love CNN? I'm pretty sure there's a tiny crack in something or other over here as a result that must be newsworthy.

Could someone please explain why FAYE.org needs help? What is wrong with her? I see that post frequently at different sites. I'm sure that magnitude of an earthquake is scary to some. I live on the weat coast in Washington state, there expecting a large quake here one of these days. They are hitting everywhere but here and that makes it even more frightening.~Mary~

What a pile of ** STUFF ** !!  None of this is close to reality. In two years, this President has jacked up the national debt without a slingle effort to control it, until AFTER the tea party representatives were ELECTED.  They were elected to reign in uncontrolled spending by an Administration that has not the slightest idea of the damage they are doing to this country. Are you aware that this year, $ 250 billion dollars is spent by the American public via their Federal taxes, merely to finance the existing debt ? Thats 250 BILLION dollars – can you think of anything you might want to do with that kind of money? But no, our President merely wants to more Federal spending for stimulus that doesn't work, but it does buy votes. I say no to that, and to all that propose it.

Joe: I agree with you. Obama has tried to do his best for the people of the United States of America, but the Republican party is so afraid of him and afraid that he will be re-elected that they are trying to stop him any way that they can, even if it means destroying this country to do it. Wow. It is amazing how people don't use good logic.
