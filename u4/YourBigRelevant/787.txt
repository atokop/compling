BALTIMORE (WJZ/AP)– A 5.8 magnitude earthquake in Virginia is felt in Maryland.
It happened around 1:51 p.m. Tuesday.
The U.S. Geological Survey said the earthquake was half a mile deep. Shaking was felt at the White House and all over the East Coast, as far south as Chapel Hill, N.C. People also felt it in New York and Rhode Island. Parts of the Pentagon, White House and Capitol were evacuated. There were no immediate reports of injuries.
The quake was centered near Louisa, Va., in Louisa County, which is northwest of Richmond and south of Washington.
Fire department spokesman Chief Kevin Cartwright says there have been widespread evacuations throughout the city. He says since there hasn’t been any indication of damage to buildings, officials feel it’s safe for people to return to their homes.


Many people who fled downtown high-rises were trying to reach friends and family by cell phone, but service was interrupted.
There has been damage reported in Southeast Baltimore near Bank Street where a spire from a church collapsed onto the road. There are no reports of any injuries there.
“We have been in contact with all local jurisdictions and a number are reporting damage to some infrastructure,” said MEMA spokesperson Ed Hopkins.  “Fortunately, they’re not reporting any serious injuries.”
Even though there aren’t normally earthquakes in Maryland, Hopkins said that each jurisdiction does have its own plan.
Earthquake Hits Maryland:

Adam May reports in the WJZ newsroom, strong shaking was felt. People went under doorframes for safety and some people left the building.  Some lights and televisions went off during the shaking.
Kai Jackson reports many buildings and courthouses in the area were evacuated.
Hundreds of people stayed outside on the sidewalks in downtown Baltimore, not wanting to return to their high-rise buildings.
“I’ve never felt anything like it in Baltimore.  I lived in California and I felt one there but not here,” said Johns Hopkins employee Rafael Irizarry.
“I didn’t know what was going on,” said one woman.
“5.8, that’s big.  Maybe something else is coming we should be on the lookout for,” said Mark Richey.
“I was sitting on the marble ledge and the whole thing started shaking,” said a man.  “And then it got stronger and stronger and stronger.”
“I was in Mercy Hospital and the whole building started shaking,” said one man.  “Everyone got really scared and started running outside.”
“Everything started shaking and then it stopped and then it got really bad and I started screaming and ran out of the building,” said a woman.  “It was panic.”
Once people got outside and realized the worst was over, many of them started to feel a lot better.
Delays are reported in commuter service throughout Maryland.
In downtown Baltimore, the subway system was temporarily shut down and traffic is “a mess.”
All MARC train service was suspended.
Amtrak reports train service along the Northeast Corridor between Baltimore and Washington, D.C., is operating at reduced speeds.
Amtrak says its crews are inspecting stations and railroad infrastructure before returning to normal operation. The rail service says no injuries have been reported but passengers should expect delays.
Mayor Discusses Earthquake:

Weijia Jiang spoke with the mayor.
Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake activated the city’s Emergency Operations Center  Tuesday afternoon and is meeting with city agencies to assess any issues related to the earthquake. She announced that nonessential city employees are authorized to leave work early.
Rawlings-Blake has also sent people to check out all bridges around the city and ordered police officers to check the traffic patterns downtown and help people get home safely. 
There were no mandatory evacuations but many chose to leave the downtown area.
“There have been no reports of major injuries in Baltimore and 911 is fully operational and responding to all emergencies,” said Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake. 
In the Washington area, Metro appears to have emerged from the earthquake unscathed. Dan Stessel, spokesman for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, says there are no immediate reports of injuries or damage to the area’s extensive metro rail system. But he says all trains have been slowed to 15 m.p.h. and officials are performing a system-wide track inspection.
Maryland state employees have returned to the statehouse after an evacuation lasting roughly 30 minutes due to the earthquake.
Raquel Guillory, a spokeswoman for Gov. Martin O’Malley, says staff in a meeting on the second floor thought something was falling off the building. She says the room she was meeting with other staffers was shaking.
Several staffers said they initially thought scaffolding around the statehouse dome, which is being repainted, had collapsed. One staffer hid under a desk, and others stood in a doorway before they left the building.
Rick Abbruzzese, a spokesman for O’Malley, says: “We really felt like it was going to come through the ceiling at any second.”
The East Coast gets earthquakes, but usually smaller ones.
The National Weather Service’s West Coast and Alaska Tsunami Warning Center said the location of the quake was far enough inland that it didn’t threaten to trigger a tsunami on the coast.
Director Paul Whitmore said the center has gauges up and down the East Coast and none of them were detecting tsunami activity.
Federal officials say two nuclear reactors at the North Anna Power Station in Louisa County, Va., were automatically taken off line by safety systems around the time of the earthquake. Nuclear Regulatory Commission spokesman Roger Hannah says the agency was not immediately aware of any damage at nuclear power plants in the southeast.
NRC officials are still assessing the situation.
The U.S. Park Service evacuated and closed all National Mall monuments and memorials.
At Reagan National Airport outside Washington, ceiling tiles fell during a few seconds of shaking. Authorities announced it was an earthquake and all flights were put on hold.
More than 12 million people live close enough to the quake’s epicenter to feel shaking, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.
The agency said this quake was in the yellow alert category for economic damage, meaning there was potential for local damage but it would add up to far less than 1 percent of the country’s gross domestic product.
East Coast earthquakes are far less common than in the West, but they tend to be felt over a broad area. That’s because the crust is not as mangled and fractured, allowing seismic waves to travel without interruption.
“The waves are able to reverberate and travel pretty happily out for miles,” said U.S. Geological Survey seismologist Susan Hough.

Police are asking residents not to call 911 to report an earthquake unless there is an emergency.
More Eyewitness Accounts:

Mike Hellgren spoke to residents in Annapolis.
This was the equivalent of more than 10,000 tons of dynamite.  People panicked, unsure of what was happening.  Many evacuated buildings as the ground rumbled.
“Suddenly the house was moving this way and that way,” said a woman.
“Everything just started shaking and falling.  I thought I had knocked something down,” said one man.
“Chairs started to rumble a little and then all of a sudden, some trophies started to rattle.  We realized it was an earthquake,” said one woman. 
The State House in Annapolis doesn’t appear to have suffered any damage.
 ”It startled me,” said one person. 
“Now I can say I’ve lived through an earthquake,” said another.

It only lasted 15 seconds my first thought was it was a low flying helicopter in the Halethorpe area. Back in the 90′s I was in York PA it was around 5 am and was shook to the point of falling to the ground a lot more intense then this. This is becoming a Media hyperbol.

I live in Sparks, MD and at 1:50 my entire house shook.  It felt like a hurricane was hitting our house and moving it from side to side, but when I looked outside there was no wind.   It lasted about 15-20 seconds.  When it was over there was no actual damage, but it was an amazing feeling.  I’ve never experienced anything like it before.

I’m in Dundalk too.  First thought it was a truck rumbling by, then thought it was the neighbors who have been working on the place next door (we share a wall).  When all that was ruled out, I knew what it was.  Talk about scary.  My first and hopefully my last.  Fortunately, I didn’t lose power.  My house shook, but surprisingly, not a thing fell over.

Felt the quake here on Fort Meade MD. Felt the house shaking, thought maybe someone was on the roof. Went outside to see what all the ruckus was about because it sounded like several people were running on the roof. Saw our cars shaking, fell to the ground in terror, ran and grabbed my 3 year old son and went outside. Still shaking from being scared.

I live in Middle River, MD and before the earthquake hit, both of my dogs were alert and stiffened. The first waves felt were minor like someone was driving a Tractor Trailer by. But then the real thing hit, it felt like the house was being twisted apart. Things were falling from the walls, shelves and cabinets. The T.V. fell but i caught it. The whole time my dogs were freaking out, so i ran outside of the house because i was being hit by falling objects. And then as soon as it had started, it was gone.

Chestertown, MD (Maryland’s Eastern Shore) A LOT of shaking.  Entire house shook, wind chimes ringing, pictures rattling, hanging plants swinging.   Flet like the house was going to fall apart. Very unsettling.

We had pictures fall down and the brick arch over my fireplace came tumbling down.  Looking around for more damage.  My husband is on his way home from work.  The whole house was actually swaying.  It lasted about 20 seconds.  How scarey!

That had to be the biggest one in Pasadena MD. I also left my building and went outside and could feel and hear the ground shaking. Everyone one came out and we all just confirmed what had happened. My son, Mike, was driving and didn’t feel it in the car. He’s disappointment he missed it by about 2 minutes.

I live in Reisterstown, Maryland and I was standing in my doorway waiting for the fedex man to drop off boxes in my garage and I heard this sound like door knobs hitting the wall or pictures hitting the wall. All the sudden I was rocking back and forth! My daughter was on the stairs and she was moving back and forth. My other daughter was in the bathroom and the towlet was moving back and forth. None of our phones work, cell or house phone. We have tv and internet. The fedex guy thought his truck was rolling he ran up from inside the truck and put on his brake! I was just amazed I couldn’t move except to lean against my door! I still feel dizzy!

Shake, Rattle & Roll in COLUMBIA, MD.  The whole house waved and bounced.  My Australian Shephard bolted for safe cover in the bathroom, shaking more than the 6.0 quake.  It was so scary that even I couldn’t understand for a moment what was happening.  Thought a car accident went off on Route 108, or a gas main broke.  This morning, the electricity went off to 1500 homes in our area.  I hope this had nothing to do with this.
I always knew we were on a fault and have earthquake insurance, which according to agent, is only good if the whole house caves in.  Well, this was a doozy.
Lets pray that there will be no more shocks, my neighborhood ladies and I hugged from the fear of what happened.  Too much.  Mother Nature needs to take a breather, and we are all waiting for Hurricane Irene.  Keep safe. Y’all Hons.

I was taking a nap and all of a sudden I felt the ground move and I thought it was a MTA bus or truck. But it shook more than a second and I stayed still in bed and my walls seem to caving in or turning.  It felt as if my bedroom was titling as the ground shook. I wasn’t afraid but it felt very odd and we had a earthquake in Maryland months ago. Can’t get ahold of my dad at work on his mobile phone. Very worried.

Where did you get your data?  The epicenter was 1 km (about 0.6 miles) below surface; magnitude was 5.9 not 6.0.  It’s a logarithmic scale, so the error is not trivial.

I was working at my desk in the Parish Office of All Saints’ Church in historic Reisterstown and I felt it! Since I’ve been through earthquakes in Central America, it was pretty obvious to me that this was one. Thankfully, it didn’t last too long. I didn’t even have to go outside (as we would have in Central America)!

A few seconds later, the office felt like a shifting Fun House Floor!! There are Cracks in the Stair Wells and Walls.  We all Evacuated… But They Sent Us Back In???? I don’t Like This!  They said we could not go up one of the stairs because of the stairstep cracks on the concrete walls, but they said to use the ELEVATOR!!!!!! ARE THEY NUTS????

Hi this is Dawn from fallston. Felt the tremor as I was lying on my sofa recouping.First thought was the dog was shaking my sofa scratching herself. Once my windows started rattling and house was making noise, new something was wrong. My kids were outside playing and got scared. The cuteset comment made was, Was that a ghost moving through the house?
You just had to laugh!!! I think everyone needs to relax and stay calm there is nothing we can do but accept that it happen and get over it. Lets see if we get aftershocks!!!!

Well it’s official. It’s a 5.9. I was sitting in my town home with my 3 kids. I started feeling the chair shake. Then started feeling the house shake. Then everything was shaking and going nuts. And heard loud sounds and i told the kid’s to get out of the house quick. And stop taking so long to get out the door. I live in dundalk maryland. And i was really scared this place would going to fall apart. Today is my son’s 6th birthday!. And he said to me. Wow daddy i never felt that before!. And i told him yea in my 30 year’s baby i never felt anything like that!

It is a rare event for us to feel an earthquake here in Maryland….seems that the anxiety level was higher than the quake.  I never experienced anything like this before but can’t understand all of this drama…people leaving work early, I don’t think it is justified except if you work in an old high rise building in Baltimore.    Some people are evacuating in buildings that are fairly new and a couple of stories high.  That is stupid.

Felt the earthquake here in my Baltimore City apartment while sitting at my computer then running to the doorway as it was the only thing I could think to do at the moment. The first thing I noticed was my feet vibrating, and then my computer moniter started rocked back and forth. The first thing I thought of was bomb due to recently watching the tv show Jericho just last weekon netflix, but since I figured im still alive I knew it was a earthquake, and a pretty strong one. One of my most frightening life experiences for sure.

Climate change, yet another violation of our rights.  Add it to the list of gov’t violations of our rights:
They violate the 1st Amendment by placing protesters in cages, banning books like “America Deceived II” and censoring the internet.
They violate the 2nd Amendment by confiscating guns.
They violate the 4th and 5th Amendment by molesting airline passengers.
They violate the entire Constitution by starting undeclared wars for foreign countries.
Impeach Obama, vote for Ron Paul.

NAACP says Whitey is to blame. They say God hates all white people. Tim Stevens says all whiteys must feel God’s wrath. Tim’s great great great great  grandaddy’s half cousin was a slave.

I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumbling down
I feel my heart start to trembling
Whenever you’re around

unless you’re from California, Maryland I don’t care how big your earthquakes are! Californians chose to live in earthquake central. We’re over here on the East Coast. I’d like to see how the West Coast would handle a “little” tornado

I lived in MD for over 50 years.  Moved to CA seven years ago where we have earthquakes very frequently.  I’m visiting family in Pasadena and felt the biggest earthquake of my life!   Now we are preparing for hurrican Irene!  Thanks Marty from your old neighbor Sharon.

For someone who has never been through an earthquake before, it was down right nerve-wracking. Our many of our West Coast friends need to be kinder about it, however. I’ve been chuckling over some of the clever Tweets, but some people have been down right nasty and scornful about our reaction to the quake. Just because they are experienced doesn’t mean we all are going to react the same as them to something we are not accustomed to. Dump two feet of snow on them and then the shoe will be on the other foot.

Mike-You obviously are the idiot as rain and wind are not associated with an earthquake. Do some research before posting!

I agree with you.  It felt definately more than moderate in the White Marsh area as well.  Our house was shaking a whole lot.

Hey lady, you’re way too tightly wound. Mike made a very funny witty comment and you’re bent all out of shape. There was no reason to cuss him out. You act like a irritated old maid. Get a life.
