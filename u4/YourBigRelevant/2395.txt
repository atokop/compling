Comments of the Moment 
“ Jamie Quatro has a funny piece that appeared in McSweeney's  that appeared quite a while back. It is the Ten Commandments in text. I am going to give it to my HS class this term. ”

Less Is More: Using Social Media to Inspire Concise Writing



“ I think that people should commemorate in anyway they want to, but not be offensive to the attacks of 9/11. The fundraising idea is great, and maybe they could do it on the New York High Line as well. On this day students' should have a day off with their family and really understand the history behind 9/11. I hope this day will be commemorated around the world.”

— Rachel K
What Are the Right and Wrong Ways to Commemorate 9/11?



“ I was in eighth grade when the towers fell.  I was in my classroom 19 blocks from the Twin Towers when the planes struck.  I remember every detail of that day. 

The school in which I was sitting at the time of the attack is a progressive K-8 school in Greenwich Village.  Each year our homeroom curriculum focused on a particular subject and other disciplines found ways to incorporate that topic.  In seventh grade my homeroom's focus was the culture and belief system of Islam. I cannot express how grateful I am to have gained an un-biased perspective on Islamic tradition before the attacks.  Because of my curriculum, even as a 13-year-old I was fully aware that this horrible event was perpetrated by a small, fanatical group of Muslims and that the community overall was peaceful and loving.

Teaching 9/11 | Ideas and Projects From Teachers



“ When I was in third grade, there was a little girl whose name was Yvonne.  She was the reject of the class.  Nobody liked her.  She smelt bad, and she was “weird”.  I look back on that time in my life, sadly, because I am ashamed that I never stood up for her, or told others to be nice to her.  Now, I wish I could go back and give her a hug, invite her to parties and get togethers, and just be her friend.  But of course, there is no going back, is there?

How Should Schools Address Bullying?



“ Anti-bullying has to be cultivated into our culture as a way of life. I feel like scaring people into behaving decently towards others by implementing rules and regulations will not solve much of the problems. Most bullies are either rebellious and don't like following rules  or they don't really realize that they are bullies so they would not even know to think that the rules apply to them. ”

— Hannah
How Should Schools Address Bullying?



“ Today is the day to read W.H. Auden's "September 1, 1939."”

Aug. 30, 1963 | Communications 'Hot Line' Connects Soviet and U.S. Heads of State 



“ As a thriving college student, I can say with full confidence that nothing helped to prepare me  for college more than my high school journalism experience. It was a life changing experience that taught me independence, time management, communication, and so much more. A big thanks to all the wonderful teachers who help to keep these programs alive across the country.”

— E.Huberlie
Student Journalism | Three Benefits of Newspaper Programs



“ In South Florida Katrina hit softer than expected but being my first hurricane it felt like the end of the world was near. The second hurricane was Wilma. This was the one that marked my life. Everything was destroyed. When all the neighbors came out of their house to inspect the final damage we all looked at each other with a certain happiness that we were all safe. This is when the community came together. The whole neighborhood decided to hold a barbecue. We all sat under the stars at night and told each other how happy we were to have such an amazing community to rely on. It showed me how in times of crisis we all come together to form a strong community and a sense of belonging.”

— Maria Camila M
Have You Experienced a Severe Weather Event?



“ Sexual education is key to any progressive and healthy community. Without it ignorance abounds, and that is the cause for so many unwanted pregnancies and sexual transmitted diseases. To this day I can remember asking my mother things that made me blush and stutter, and she answering with such nonchalance that I forgot my embarrassment with the topic and let my curiosity take over. Without her honesty, I know this part of my life where hormones rage would have been so much harder. ”

— Laura S.
How Did You Learn About Sex?



“ As I read the article: “Do we Need a New Way to Teach Math?”  I realized that one of the reasons why I love math so much I because it teaches you how to “think logically. We carefully state the problem, plan out our solution, execute steps in the appropriate order, and evaluate the solution.” ”

— Tatiana
Do We Need a New Way to Teach Math?



“ Having lived in Miami for three years I have had the opportunity to experience several Hurricanes. I must admit that I was very lucky in all of them, nothing happened to me my family or my goods.  The worst thing that happened was that the lights went out for several hours and that we had to stay in doors listening to the news in a little radio. ”

— CarlosAP
Have You Experienced a Severe Weather Event?



“ I think the "useless" and abstract concepts we learn in math help our use of logic greatly. Nelly Bateman, a math graduate, teacher in school (and not to mention the best mom ever) explains "the reason why math is so important is greatly due to the fact that it encompasses abstract concepts. Finding a numerical value for a letter helps your brain organize information, assimilate it and use logic and previous knowledge to find an answer. What students learn in high school is not rocket science. How are they supposed to know if they do or don't want to be mathematicians of physicians if they have never taken a calculus class before?" ”

— Laura
Do We Need a New Way to Teach Math?



“ I am a student, and to be honest I really thought history was boring because all of the dates you had to remember for tests. But now by reading this learning network article  I started to think about how you really need to deeply understand the history of something. And by understanding it you will realize that it is essential to human life. I think 9/11 should be taught in schools across the world, and we shouldn't neglect it, we should understand and remember the event.”
