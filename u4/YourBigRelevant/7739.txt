www.realestateradiousa.com | New Zealand Earthquake In Christchurch Christchurch's 400000 residents were warned to stay inside their homes as a major earthquake rattled the town. The earthquake measured 7.1 and the danger of continued aftershocks continue. In an effort to keep the peace and ensure public safety, the authorities have instituted a curfew. Police said the curfew was intended to protect the city's 400000 people from falling debris, as the quake caused widespread damage to buildings, although there were few injuries reported. Mayor Bob Parker declared a state of emergency four hours after the quake struck the east coast of the island region at 4.35am, warning that continuing aftershocks could cause masonry to fall from damaged buildings. "We're all feeling scared, we've just had some significant aftershocks," he told TV One News. "Tonight we're just people in the face of a massive natural disaster, trying to help each other ... and we're grateful we haven't lost a life." There were reports of some people trapped inside damaged buildings, although none appeared to be seriously injured. Police Inspector Alf Stewart told New Zealand's National Radio that some people had been arrested for looting. "We have some reports of people smashing [shop] windows and trying to grab some property that is not theirs ... we've got police on the streets and we're dealing with that," he said. Up to 90 extra police officers are flying to Christchurch to help, and troops are likely <b>...</b>

Wellington, New Zealand - A strong 6.3-magnitude earthquake rocked the southern New Zealand city of Christchurch on Tuesday, seriously injuring people and damaging buildings throughout the city. Live video footage showed parts of buildings collapsed into the streets, which were strewn with bricks and shattered concrete. Sidewalks and roads were cracked and split, and hundreds of dazed, screaming and crying residents wandered through the streets as sirens blared throughout the city. Christchurch Mayor Bob Parker said he was on the top floor of the city council building when the quake hit, throwing him across the room. "I got down onto the street and there were scenes of great confusion, a lot of very upset people," he said. "I know of people in our building who are injured and I've had some reports of serious injuries throughout the city." Radio New Zealand reported that a church near the city center collapsed. The station also said staffers in its Christchurch newsroom had to cling to their desks during the shaking, with large filing cabinets toppling over. Some cars apparently parked on the street were buried under rubble. "What I can see from where I am in the central city is that there are significant amounts of additional damage," Parker said. The US Geological Survey said the temblor was centered 3 miles (5 kilometers) from the city at a depth of 2.5 miles (4 kilometers). Christchurch has been hit by hundreds of aftershocks since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck <b>...</b>
