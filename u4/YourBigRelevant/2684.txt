Colorado Has Biggest Earthquake In 40 Years Just Hours Before The Virginia Quake



It seems there was another earthquake making news yesterday but it was drowned out by the coverage of the Virginia earthquake. Colorado had it’s largest earthquake in 40 years. From the Denver Post:

The strongest earthquake to hit Colorado in more than four decades startled thousands of residents along the New Mexico border as it toppled chimneys, cracked walls and triggered minor rockslides in the arid, mountainous region. No injuries were reported Tuesday.
Monday night’s magnitude-5.3 earthquake struck just hours before a magnitude-5.8 temblor in Virginia—also rare for that area—shook much of Washington, D.C., and the East Coast.
Small aftershocks rattled the region about 180 miles south of Denver but caused no further damage.
“This was the first time you could see the fear in people’s eyes,” said Dean Moltrer, 39, who with his brother Ray owns the Big 4 Country Store in Valdez, a former coal mining town of about 100 people in Colorado’s Picketwire Valley.
“Your family looks to dad to figure out what to do,” chimed in Ray Moltrer. “Dad didn’t know what to do. Dad was scared for his life.”
The quake hit at 11:46 p.m. MDT Monday about nine miles southwest of Trinidad, according to the U.S. Geological Survey’s National Earthquake Information Center in Golden. It had an estimated depth of 2.5 miles and was felt in a relatively large area of southern Colorado and northern New Mexico.
The earthquake was the largest in Colorado since a magnitude-5.3 temblor was recorded in Denver’s northern suburbs in 1967, said Paul Earle of the USGS.
Las Animas County Sheriff Jim Casias said Colorado authorities were assessing damage that included a porch collapse and a partially collapsed roof.
In Segundo, a tiny town a mile west of Valdez, the brick façade of a historic building lay in a pile. Nearby, daylight peered through a crack in the wall of Ringo’s Super Trading Post, where owner Gary Ringo said he lost thousands of dollars’ worth of liquor and soda…

I wonder what state will be next?

About The Author


Todd 
My unique perspective comes from having a Master's degree in the  Philosophy of Religion and Ethics, and from working a blue collar job in the oil industry. This blog attempts to confront both the religious and political Liberalism  which is pervasive in our society, and even our churches. I look at current events from a Christian perspective and how they affect the church and my family.
