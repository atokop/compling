					 WASHINGTON (AP) — Scientists have found another thing to blame on the climate demon El Nino: civil strife within poor tropical countries. A new study released Wednesday finds a significant increase in unrest during the years of an El Nino (el NEEN-yo), which is a regular climatic event that warms the central Pacific Ocean. It's such a noticeable jump that the scientists say there is more than just a link, but a partial cause. They say one out of five conflicts over a 55-year period were influenced partly and somehow by El Nino. It isn't the only or main cause, but 48 civil wars or uprisings had an El Nino...

NEWPORT, Ore. -- About 250 miles off the Oregon coast, scientists have for the first time ever successfully forecast an eruption of an undersea volcano. The Axial Seamount, an undersea volcano that is one of the most active and intensely studied seamounts in the world, has recently erupted. Scientists from Oregon State University, the University of Washington and Columbia University were responsible for discovering the new eruption. Bill Chadwick, an Oregon State University geologist, and Scott Nooner, of Columbia University, have been monitoring Axial Seamount for more than a decade. In 2006 the two published a paper in the Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research in which they predicted that Axial would erupt before the year 2014.

Massive Undersea Volcanic Eruption Found Off Oregon Coast Oregon State University scientists say they've discovered an eruption of an undersea volcano about 250 miles off the Oregon Coast. The April 6 eruption produced a lava flow at least 1.2 miles wide, scientists say, and there were hundreds of tiny earthquakes during the eruption. The volcano, named Axial Seamount, last erupted in 1998, and the team of OSU scientists forecasted it would erupt again before 2014. Oregon State scientists say this marks the first-ever successful forecast of an undersea volcano. The new eruption was discovered July 28 when scientists used a robot to find a new lava flow on the seafloor that was not present a year ago. Because only a handful of the earthquakes were detected from land, scientists did not initially believe there was an eruption. Bill Chadwick, an OSU geologist, says the team of scientists thought they were in the wrong place because the seafloor looked so different. "We couldn't find our markers or monitoring instruments or other distinctive features on the bottom," he says. "Once we figured out that an eruption had happened, we were pretty excited." When they recovered seafloor instruments and recorders, the scientists learned the volcanic eruption took place April 6. "So far, it is hard to tell the full scope of the eruption because we discovered it near the end of the expedition," Chadwick says. "But it looks like it might be at least three times bigger than the 1998 <b>...</b>

BILOXI, MS (WLOX) - The Coast Guard says the Gulf oil spill involves "hundreds of thousands" of patches of oil. Small boats are helping capture some of those patches by using skimmers.BP is also using dispersant chemicals to try to break up the oil. But those chemicals come with many questions about the impact on sea life, especially shrimp, crabs and oysters that we eat.Dr. Joe Griffitt with the Gulf Coast Research Lab said the chemical Corexit is EPA approved, but the dangers of using such chemicals is still unclear."They started using dispersant to keep the oil from getting onshore, to keep it out of the estuaries and marshes where the fish and crabs are. That was correct choice," said Dr. Griffitt. "But the sheer size, and it hasn't stopped. It still hasn't stopped. Perhaps you can say it would have been better off if they had left it."Dr. Griffitt said when the dispersant/oil mixture gets into the marshes and estuaries, it binds with the sediments and is difficult, if not impossible, to get out.

The University of South Florida's College of Marine Science was one of the "first responders" to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in April 2010. From the first day of the blowout, the college's scientists, researchers, staff and graduate students have been involved in tracking the spill and assessing its environmental impact. The college, located in St. Petersburg, Fla., continues to be involved analyzing and assessing the spill's impact. In this video you hear from the scientists who raced to the Gulf to collect water and oil samples and who helped predict where the oil was moving with ocean currents and wind.

MP3 www.4shared.com Genetic Engineering: On Thursday night, investigative reporter Jon Rappoport warned of alarming future trends in the genetic engineering of human beings. Based on his contacts with several scientists over a period of 20 years, he's concluded that human genetics research is basically a continuation of the Nazi eugenics program, and that medical research into genes as causes of human illness is simply a cover story. Part of this secret agenda, he detailed, is to demonstrate that people have genetic predispositions to certain diseases like cancer, so in the case of lawsuits, this argument can be made rather than placing blame for illness on environmental factors like pollution. In citing the book Remaking Eden, Rappoport noted that author Lee Silver foresees a time when the "gen-rich" (genetically enhanced class) will account for 10% of the population, while "naturals" will work as low paid service providers/laborers. Eventually, the gen-rich class and the naturals will become entirely separate species, with no ability to crossbreed, Silver continued, adding that the trend for genetic enhancement was inevitable. Rappoport had no doubt that some of this research was already underway, possibly under compartmentalized lab studies, so that scientists don't even realize the significance of what they're working on. "The best thing that could happen," he stated, "is that recognized doctors and researchers stand up together, and say, this has to stop <b>...</b>

Cooper reports that very well respected independent scientists, local officials and local residents don't believe the new Government report. In fact 1 in 10 Gulf Coast residents feel that they will have to move out of the Gulf Coast area due to BP's oil spill which is now estimated to be the largest oil spill in water ever, surpassing both the Ixtoc and the Gulf War Oil Spill.

www.projectgulfimpact.org Gavin Garrison, Matt Smith, and Heather Rally Dr. Ira Leifer, a marine scientist from the University of California at Santa Barbara, has been researching the geochemical nature of oil seeps and spills for over a many years. After over a decade of experience studying hydrocarbon visualization, modeling, and geochemistry in the Santa Barbara channel, Dr. Leifer developed a recognizable expertise in the area of oil spills. Soon after the BP Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion in late April 2010, Dr. Leifer was sought out by the government and appointed to the National Incident Command's Flow Rate Technical Group. This group of highly specialized scientists was tasked with the responsibility of determining how much oil was leaking from the Macondo 252 wellhead. In this exclusive interview with Project Gulf Impact, Dr. Leifer expresses his frustration when asked to make scientifically sound conclusions based upon data that has been intentionally obscured and manipulated. Not only was he denied the proper quality of data after repeated requests, he also witnessed a blatant obscuring, by the media, of the results that ultimately were released by the flow rate group. BP argues that scientists have miscalculated the flow rate from the Macondo well, and that the actual spill size could be half the official estimate. From The Daily Hurricane "If BP gets away with reducing the flow estimate to half of the current estimate, it will be a masterful manipulation <b>...</b>

Richard Camilli, Ph.D., Associate Scientist, Dept. of Applied Ocean Physics and Engineering at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Testimony to the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling, September 27, 2010: BP had denied clearance for my team to use isobaric samplers to collect and analyze end member fluids from the leak. From an August WHOI News Release: The NSF RAPID program, which provides grants for projects having a severe urgency and require quick-response research on natural disasters or other unanticipated events, significantly speeded up the acceptance of the WHOI proposals. "In contrast to the usual six-to-eighteen-month lead time for standard scientific proposals, our plume study was funded two days after the concept was proposed to NSF and went from notification of the proposal's acceptance to boarding the Endeavor in two-and-a-half weeks," Reddy said. Within days of being notified of the award, Reddy said the WHOI team reached out to NOAA, offering assistance in the laborious, but important, process of collecting and analyzing water samples for natural resource damage assessment (NRDA). In addition to conducting the work NSF funded, the WHOI team worked cooperatively with NOAA to collect data that will be used to determine damages and calculate a fair settlement for those affected by the massive spill.

by Maya Rodriguez / Eyewitness News wwltv.com Posted on September 16, 2010 at 6:27 PM Updated yesterday at 6:38 PM NEW ORLEANS-- Some independent scientists, who have been looking into oil spill contamination in the Gulf of Mexico, said they have received some unsettling phone calls from the federal government. The calls came from attorneys, on behalf of the National Oil Spill Commission. The scientists said their questions seemed designed to cast doubts on their findings. As the oil spill unfolded, scientists from research institutions around the country descended on the Gulf to witness what ended up becoming an unprecedented environmental event. Two of those scientists included Dr. William Sawyer, a Florida-based toxicologist, and Marco Kaltofen, a scientist and head of Boston Chemical Data in Massachusetts. "Right now, the Gulf is basically a big experimental laboratory," Sawyer said. Both were hired by a New Orleans-based law firm to collect and analyze samples of water, sand and sea life that had been affected by the oil spill. "What has been most important to us is to make sure that we have independent data, that is gathered from along the coast, where our clients reside," said attorney Stuart Smith, of the Smith Stag Law Firm, which hired Sawyer and Kaltofen. The scientists looked at samples from off the coast of several Gulf states, including Louisiana. They said, so far, their findings are troubling.
