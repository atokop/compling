WASHINGTON - A 5.9 magnitude earthquake centered northwest of Richmond, Va., shook much of Washington, DC, and was felt as far north as Rhode Island, New York City and Martha's Vineyard, Mass., where President Barack Obama is vacationing. The US Geological Survey said the earthquake was half a mile deep. Shaking was felt at the White House and all over the East Coast, as far south as Chapel Hill, NC Parts of the Pentagon, White House and Capitol were evacuated. There were no immediate reports of injuries. The Pentagon was later deemed safe for reoccupation. The quake was centered near Louisa, Va., in Louisa County, which is northwest of Richmond and south of Washington. Obama and many of the nation's leaders were out of town on August vacation when the quake struck at 1:51 pm EDT. The shaking was felt on the Martha's Vineyard golf course as Obama was just starting a round. The East Coast gets earthquakes, but usually smaller ones and is less prepared than California or Alaska for shaking. At Reagan National Airport outside Washington, ceiling tiles fell during a few seconds of shaking. Authorities announced it was an earthquake and all flights were put on hold.

Earthquake on the east coast? In Virginia? We felt the ground shake under our feet. We knew it had to be an earthquake. Many kids were scared of the earthquake and ran the doors and windows to see what was going on and this is typical on how kids react. The teachers were even more scared of the earthquake tremors than the kids. The kids describe the things they saw and how they felt during the earthquake that registered a 5.8 to 5.9 They said that the tiles in the ceiling were shaking and the walls were shaking. The smart boards were swaying back and forth and the desks were shaking. Some kids were screaming and yelling very loud. 5.9M Earthquake Rocks Virginia East Coast USA It is not common for earthquakes to occur on the east coast. This is something you mostly see on the west coast such as in California. People evacuated the pentagon. This was not funny at all. Earthquakes cause devastation. Are these girls brave? Are the kids braver than the teachers? What would you do if you were in the middle of class and the room started to shake suddenly and you heard a very loud rumble sound? This earthquake did not cause any damage here and no one was hurt. Many people were scared though. Some were questioning if this was a sign from God. Many think this is the sing that the world is coming to an end. Post a comment or video response and let us know what you think. Did you feel the earthquake? If so how intense was it. Were you scared? Did you just go on like nothing happened <b>...</b>
