Labor Day Groundwater Special: Exempt Wells in Montana and Transboundary Aquifers (Water International, Vol. 36, Issue 5)


It's always a great day for groundwater, but this is really something.
Jesse Richardson of the Water Systems Council sent me a couple of links to two documents from the Montana Legislature's Water Policy Interim Committee (WPIC).
One deals with exempt well options:
Download Exempt_Well_Options_MTWPIC
The second deals with groundwater, exempt wells and enforcing a water right through a call:
Download Exempt_Well_Calls_MTWPIC
  And if those documents aren't enough, Todd Jarvis sent me the link to Water International's special issue (volume 36, issue 5) on Strengthening Cooperation on Transboundary Groundwater Resources. It's edited by Alice Aureli of UNESCO-IHP and Gabriel Eckstein, Director of the International Water Law Project.
You will be able to read the abstracts but you will have to pay for the articles unless you are a member of the International Water Resources Association (IWRA). 
Enjoy!

Earth to '1000 Wells for Darfur': SOS?


You can take 'SOS' to mean any one of a few meanings. I know which one I meant. And it's not the universal call for help.
Last 21 February I posted, Has '1000 Wells for Darfur' Dried Up? , in which I wondered what had happened to the project to help the oppressed people of Darfur gain access to clean water.
Here's what I wrote back then:

Remember all the fuss several years ago about an 'ancient mega-lake' discovered beneath the desert of north Darfur, and how its entrapped groundwater might alleviate the suffering of the Darfur people?
 Yes, from that discovery, which garnered a lot of publicity for discoverer Dr. Farouk El-Baz and his group at Boston University's Center for Remote Sensing,arose a project to drill 1000 wells for Darfur. El-Baz met with Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir (the two are shown here) and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. it looked like something positive was going to happen.
I last posted about this on 24 January 2008; in this post you will find links to my previous five posts, one of which expressed skepticism about the as-yet undiscovered groundwater (but the potential was there).
So what is the project's status?
There is a item about the BU students' well on the Center's WWW site and access to a slew of news items, most of which are several years old.
The GSA Foundation announced the launching of the '1000 Wells for Darfur' initiative on its WWW site. The following was included in the announcement:
“Access to fresh water is essential for refugee survival, will help the peace process, and provides the necessary resources for the much needed economic development in Darfur,” said El-Baz.
“Any person, organization or county can contribute to this humanitarian effort. Those who provide $10 million or drill 10 wells will have their names on the wells forever,” El-Baz added. “New water resources will provide hope to the people of northwestern Sudan and will also allow for the migration of the labor force closer to the wells, where economic development is suitable and environmentally sustainable.”
It does appear that 1000 Wells for Darfur has now become 1001 Wells for Darfur - one for good luck, perhaps. Or maybe that is the BU students' well. TheWWW site doesn't look like much is happening, and the blog contains personals and job postings. There is no way to make a donation even though it says you can. In short, it looks like someone set up this site a few years ago and then promptly forgot about it. I just sent them an email (info@1001wells.org) inquiring about the project's status.

Two things to remember:
1) The existence of a large groundwater body in the area has not been proven. The remote sensing data suggest that one may exist (see yesterday's post  about ground truthing). To my knowledge, no test well has been drilled. So it is premature to say that you are going to drill 100o wells, or even 100. The drilling of a test well (s) should be done ASAP.
2) It would be insufficient merely to drill wells for the locals. They must also be trained to maintain the wells and pumps so that they can control their own water future, insofar as that is possible.
 Now for the response to my email last February. Someone named Karim Zahran replied to my inquiry with this:

Mr. Campana...Thank you for getting in touch with us in regards to our Darfur water project. The 1001 Wells project is not fully blown out and running as planned because of the political events and situation in Sudan. As you know, we are planning to go to Darfur under the UN Umbrella, and the UN has significantly reduced its presence in Sudan in the past couple of years. However, different university groups are continuing with their efforts to raise awareness and money on the university level until we resume with our initiative.

I just checked out the WWW site and it looks a little cleaner, although no new information has been posted. There is nothing about which university groups are 'continuing with their efforts to raise awareness and money' as Zahran stated in his reply. I would think that these groups would be listed on the site to let people know that something is happening. Is there some kind of coordinated effort? I suspect not.
The blog still has a bunch of unrelated personal comments; Dr. Farouk El-Baz's blog has not been updated. There is no mechanism by which you can donate money, which is probably good because no one is doing anything.
I also must call out the GSA Foundation ,which launched the '1000 Wells for Darfur' initiative on its WWW site. I have been a member of the parent  Geological Society of America for 35+ years and consider it a fine organization. But the GSAF has dropped the ball, too.
I understand that Sudan is not an easy place in which to work. But I think the promoters of this initiative realized this at the time. And since South Sudan (not where Darfur is, by the way) has separated from the north, one might think it's as good a time as any to get this thing going. 
 The only things that have been generated by this project are a lame WWW site and huge amounts of favorable publicity for the GSA Foundation, Boston University, Farouk El-Baz, the UN and Ban Ki-moon, and of course, that criminal Omar al-Bashir. 
The people of Darfur? Who? [Photo from here, courtesy of the AP.]
Maybe someone sent them some bottled water (perhaps not a bad idea, given what hasn't happened).
Way to go, guys. 
 "The Darfur initiative will bring hope to the people of northwestern Sudan; it will allow the migration of the labour force to locations where economic development is suitable and environmentally sustainable. This initiative can be a starting point for ameliorating the human suffering in the region and raising the quality of life and capacity of its people." -- Dr. Farouk El-Baz, 25 June 2007

Where in Nevada Is Wally Spencer's Lost Underground River?


Friend and former student (my first graduate student, and still one of the best) Don Mahin of Reno, NV, sent me links to these videos (c. 1993) from the TV show Unsolved Mysteries. They describe the case of Wally Spencer, who claimed to have discovered a huge 'underground river' (cavernous aquifer?) beneath Nevada. Spencer's 'river' allegedly was originally discovered by two prospectors in 1927, who dynamited the only known opening to keep their treasure (gold) from the landowner. Spencer was a rocket scientist who used satellite imagery and some kind of device of his own design to locate the 'river'. 
I know nothing of the details of Spencer's work, but the show left me with the impression that Spencer was foiled by Nevada's 'red tape' vis-a-vis water rights. He had 'found' all this water and the state officials were jerking him around. Naturally, he was concerned that his secret would be stolen and he would be left with nothing.
I don't see it that way. Nevada was simply asking him to demonstrate that the water actually existed. Spencer supposedly estimated the daily flow at 17B gallons (c. 52,000 acre-feet per day) but there is no indication of where that number came from. That is a lot of water - the mean daily flow of the Colorado River is around 38,000 acre-feet per day). No wonder the state was a bit skeptical. I am, too.
Recall that Spencer never sunk a well to prove that the water was there. That step is critical whenever you rely on indirect data - such as remotely-sensed or geophysical data -- to ascertain whether there is available groundwater. You need to ground truth the data - drill a well. The folks in the oil patch know this all too well. All the data in the world may point to an oil or gas body, but until you put the hole in the ground you're just blowing smoke. 
I like what Michael Turnipseed said - that Spencer, with his allegedly unproven technology - was little better than someone walking around with a willow stick divining for water.
Unfortunately, Spencer died in 2003 without ever drilling for water. The exact location of the 'river' remains a mystery.
You can judge for yourself, or maybe not, given the sparse information in the show.
Here is Part 1:
 
Part 2 (just 1:24 long):
 
It is interesting to note that Spencer first made his claim in 1989, just about the time SNWA was filing its claims to subsurface water in large parts of rural Nevada. Just a coincidence.
Guess we'll never know. But if 'Wally's Water' is out there, SNWA probably has filed a water rights claim.

TGIF - Tweets Galore! It's Friday, 2 September 2011 - Special Labor Day Edition


As many of us in the USA prepare to   celebrate the Labor Day weekend, let's not forget that some of our fellow citizens are not enjoying the last weekend of the summer but are instead dealing with injury, death, and damage caused by floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, and other natural disasters. Outside the USA, people are grappling with famine and a variety of conditions we don't generally experience. I know the USA economy is sputtering, but if you can, reach inside your pocket and support your favorite organization that provides domestic and/or international assistance. There are mnay good organizations; I won't mention any. If you want to check their 'charitable rating' visit a site such as Charity Navigator or GuideStar.
Here is a site where you can volunteer or contribute to help Hurricane Irene victims in Vermont.
Lots of Tweets this past week. Enjoy, and have a great weekend!

Review of the Use of Science & Adaptive Management in California's Draft BDCP


Hard to believe that 2011 is two-thirds gone!
Lloyd G. Carter reminded me to announce the availability of the final published version of the NRC Panel's review of the Draft Bay-Delta Conservation Plan (BDCP). The 'prepublication' copy was released in May 2011 (see my blog post and the news release).
At the final report's site you can either freely download a PDF, read it online, or purchase a paper copy. It contains no new material; it's just been copy-edited.
Read the report summary.
The following is a description from the WWW site:

 The San Francisco Bay Delta Estuary is a large, complex estuarine ecosystem in California. It has been substantially altered by dikes, levees, channelization, pumps, human development, introduced species, dams on its tributary streams and contaminants. The Delta supplies water from the state's wetter northern regions to the drier southern regions and also serves as habitat for many species, some of which are threatened and endangered. The restoration of water exacerbated tensions over water allocation in recent years, and have led to various attempts to develop comprehensive plans to provide reliable water supplies and to protect the ecosystem. One of these plans is the Bay Delta Conservation Plan (BDCP).
The report, A Review of the Use of Science and Adaptive Management in California's Draft Bay Delta Conservation Plan, determines that the plan is incomplete in a number of important areas and takes this opportunity to identify key scientific and structural gaps that, if addressed, could lead to a more successful and comprehensive final BDCP. The plan is missing the type of structure usually associated with current planning methods in which the goals and objectives are specified, alternative measure for achieving the objectives are introduced and analyzed, and a course of action in identified based on analytical optimization of economic, social, and environmental factors. Yet the panel underscores the importance of a credible and a robust BDCP in addressing the various water management problems that beset the Delta. A stronger, more complete, and more scientifically credible BDCP that effectively integrates and utilizes science could indeed pave the way toward the next generation of solutions to California's chronic water problems.

Enjoy! 
Disclosure notice: I was on the panel that produced this report.
"A deal is a deal. If more water is necessary, the key to finding water is money. Everything is available for a price." -- Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt, referring to the Bay-Delta, 1994 (thanks to Mark Grossi)

Shout-Out to Snooki: Global Warming Gobbledygook


Jersey Shore's Snooki [aka Nicole Polizzi] lends her gravitas and other attributes to global warming and a few other things.









 
As Jess Zimmerman says in his Grist post, the good part comes around 2:20:

Every time I go down the seaside, I'm sweating in places I've never sweated before. Obviously, the sun's coming closer to Earth, and we're all just sweating our balls off. So if we don't take care of this problem and, you know, make an ozone layer somewhere, the aliens are going to attack Earth and kill us all.

WTF? She makes Michele Bachmann sound reasonable. But she might make more of an impression on some than Al Gore. Sad...
Tongue-in-cheek, perhaps. Or wherever.
Next up: JWoww
 "I go crazy in this house, living with nutjobs.. I just need somebody from back home to bounce me back & be like, you’re OK.' - Snooki

Agua Para La Vida's Ojo de Agua Newsletter No. 2 - en Español


Denis Barea of Agua Para La Vida in Nicaragua just sent me the second issue of APLV's Spanish newsletter, Ojo de Agua (literally, 'eye of water' which is often translated into English as 'spring' or 'body of water'). The newsletter is in Spanish because, well, APLV works in Nicaragua.  
Download Ojo de agua #2
The Ann Campana Judge Foundation supports APLV.
APLV operates the excellent Escuela Técnica de Agua Potable in Rio Blanco.
If you missed the first newsletter, click here.
Disfrute! Enjoy!

Boost Your Conference Attendance: Stage a Machine Gun Community Event!


 The National Ground Water Association (NGWA) is one of my two major professional societies. I served on its Board of Directors for four years (2002 through 2005), was a Vice President (2002 and 2003),  and chaired its largest division, the Scientists and Engineers Division, in 2002 and 2003.
Each year in early December, NGWA convenes its signature event, the Ground Water Expo, which is generally held in Las Vegas every other year. It's the place to see the latest equipment and meet members from across the groundwater industry: scientists and engineers, contractors (well drillers, pump installers), manufacturers, and suppliers - the four groups comprising the NGWA's divisions. NGWA also convenes the Ground Water Summit, held each spring since 2005, the main event of the S & E division.
Imagine my surprise (not really) when I when I read about a certain Community Event at this year's Expo:

 How accurate is your shot? Find out when you shoot a fully automatic machine gun and your choice of handgun. Join your fellow groundwater professionals at The Gun Store and receive a complimentary T-shirt, VIP accommodations, private instruction, and complimentary (nonalcoholic) beverages.
Before and after your time at the range, challenge your colleagues to a game of pinball at the nearby Pinball Hall of Fame. Here you can play more than 200 vintage pinball machines…and all the quarters you put into the games help to support the Las Vegas Salvation Army.
Preregistration and ticket required—cost on or before October 28 is $95; thereafter $125. The shuttle to and from The Gun Store and Pinball Hall of Fame begins at 8:30 a.m., departing from the convention center
 

Western Rubber and Manufacturing is the official sponsor of The Gun Store sharpshooter competition.
 When I told Mary Frances about this event, I got the same look as the one she gave me upon learning that she was a member of NGWA's (Ladies') Auxiliary (since disbanded) when I became the S & E Division chair and a Vice President of NGWA. No words were necessary - just a disdainful 'WTF?' look.
Given the battles over NGWA governance that I recall [the Contractors had the system gamed so that their division, with 25% of the membership, controlled things] I'm not sure a sharpshooter competition is a good idea. On the other hand....
 In fairness to NGWA, the leadership of the Contractors' Division has changed and is now far more progressive than when I was on the national board. It's no longer 1955. And rumor has it that a revised governance plan will be unveiled at the 2011 Expo.
Unfortunately, I cannot go this year because I am committed to attend the UNESCO-IHP and UC-Irvine groundwater conference which they scheduled  to coincide with the Expo, a stupid move on their part.
For now, I've got to get AWRA on board with this machine gun stuff! What a legacy!

Vapur's Foldable Water Anti-Bottle: Alternative to Rigid Water Bottles


Rest assured that I am not shilling for the following product. No one contacted me about posting this item or promoting the product described herein. 
Foldable plastic water bottles are nothing new - I have a couple of large ones. But yesterday I encountered the 'Anti-Bottle' by Vapur. It's made of BPA-free plastic and is foldable, freezable, dishwasher-safe, USA-made, and attachable (carabiner). It holds 0.5 liters (about 16 fluid ounces) and stands upright when full. For those of us who like to drink tap water but would prefer a container that is not rigid, this looks like it will fill the bill.
 Vapur also has a 0.4 liter size. You can buy both sizes on the WWW site for $8 (0.4L) and $10 (0.5L), I purchased one of Vapur's 'Artist Series'  versions (that's all they had at the store I visited) for $12. I got the 'Aqua Libre' design (shown here).There are two other designs.
Since I've owned it for barely 24 hours, I cannot attest to its ruggedness. The clip itself seems strong, but since water is rather heavy - a half-liter is about a pound - I don't know how quickly the carabiner will tear through the plastic. The bottle is guaranteed for one year.
Feel free to post any comments about the product or other similar products.
I know - some of you are no doubt wondering: "WTF has this guy been?" Answer: Ashland, OR.
"Remember: Vapur spelled backwards is Rupav." -- the anti-slogan (NOT!)

2011 OU WaTER Conference: More Presentations, Reduced Registration Extended to 7 September


  Serious shill alert: I serve on the External Advisory Board of OU's WaTER Center. I also think the Center and its four original founding members - Dave Sabatini, Robert Knox, Randy Kolar, and Bob Nairn - come as close to 'walking on water' as human beings can get. But I would never say that to their faces. And Molly Smith keeps things running smoothly!
Anyway, the early bird registration  rate has been extended until 7 September 2011. Register here. 
Ninety abstracts have been submitted, a 30% increase over the inaugural 2009 conference. 
Here is a Power Point flyer with all the information:  Download WaTERConfAd_AEESP_v4
Here's the blurb:

The Water Technologies for Emerging Regions (WaTER) Center at the University of Oklahoma will host the 2011 OU International WaTER Conference and Interna- tional Water Prize Award Ceremony on October 24-25, 2011, in Norman, Oklahoma. The conference will bring together participants from multiple groups responding to the UN Millennium Development Goals focused on bringing water and sanitation to remote villages in emerging regions. Water and sanitation experts from academia, industry, NGOs, government, and foundations are invited to participate.
The theme of the two-day conference is “Synergy at the Interface: Integrating Tech nology, Social Entrepreneurship and Behavior Change.” The conference will include poster and paper sessions devoted to appropriate WASH technologies, social entre preneurship, behavior change, climate change effects/water resources and conserva tion and reuse technologies in emerging regions. Optional workshops on field methods will be provided on October 26.
The highlight of the conference will be a plenary lecture by and presentation of the OU International Water Prize to Ben Fawcett, a Professor and Environmental Health Engineer at the University of Queensland, Australia. During his tenure at Southamton University from 1996-2006 he mentored 130 MSc and PhD students who have continued through their work to impact over 60 countries. He is also the co-author of The Last Taboo: Opening the Door on the Global Sanitation Crisis.
In addition to the plenary lecture by Ben Fawcett, keynote speakers will include:

Ned Breslin, Water for People – Hydrophilanthropy
Annette Johnson, Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology – Water Technologies
Dennis Lettenmaier, University of Washington – Water Resources/Climate Change
John Oldfield, WASH Advocacy Initiative – Legislative Update
Kurt Soderlund, Safe Water Network – Social Entrepreneurship
Peter Winch, Director, Social and Behavioral Interventions Program, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health – Behavior Change


 I will see you there!
"To help solve drinking water and sanitation challenges for impoverished regions in developing countries through innovative teaching and research initiatives." -- WaTER Center mission

TGIF - Tweets Galore! It's Friday, 26 August 2011 - Special Shakespeare Edition


 When you read this Mary Frances and I will be in Ashland, OR, at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival. It's our annual trek to see some Shakespeare and other plays. This year we will see four in three days. We will see Henry IV, Part Two; Julius Caesar; The African Company Presents Richard III; andGhost Light.

Julius Caesar was great. Done in-the-round, we had front row seats. The actors wore a variety of garb, plus Caesar was portrayed as a woman by a woman.
Shameless plug: we're staying at the Chanticleer Inn, a great B & B. 
I really like Ashland, which is on I-5 between Medford and the California state line (about 15 miles north). I sometimes think about retiring here but realize that making such a decision based on visiting three days per year is a foolish one. For now, it's the proverbial nice place to visit...
Enough already - here is your weekend water displacement behavior facilitator.

Of Gargoyles and Gorillas: Ben Grumbles on EPA's Upcoming CWA Stormwater Regulations


Ben Grumbles, former EPA Assistant Administrator and current President of the Clean Water America  Alliance (CWAA), recently opined on EPA and stormwater regulations in his August 2011 Presidential Pipeline column. I have copied it below. [Note: AWRA has an MOU with the Alliance and I have personally contributed to the CWAA.]

Not to mix religion and politics, but the fantastic fixtures on cathedrals and other buildings are speaking a lot to me these days (so far only figuratively), as green infrastructure cheerleaders and EPA critics gear up for a politically-bruising battle over stormwater regulations. We should all look up from time to time in our search for progress and common ground--from the curb and the fence line to the gutters and rooftops, to the forest canopies and landscapes beyond the big box.
 Look up the word "gargoyle" and you'll find Latin and French roots meaning "throat" and "gullet". Think of gargle and spew. If all goes well, the artful spouts channel both rain water and evil spirits away from the building.
Today's important issues over stormwater have evolved into complex technical, financial, legal, policy, and political choices, and much of the drama is playing out on the national stage with EPA's upcoming Clean Water Act (CWA) stormwater regulations. Art, skill, luck, and good will are needed to find the right mix at the right level.
Understandably, there's concern about potential costs and constraints imposed by strangers with big hammers (or gorillas with federal badges, so to speak). Home builders, property owners, and policymakers are asking some legitimate questions about legal authority and fiscal austerity surrounding potential EPA CWA post-construction standards and property retrofit requirements. But there are also great opportunities to drive green infrastructure locally  and regionally with thoughtful, flexible standards.
With that in mind, the Clean Water America Alliance teamed up with American Rivers to  identify principles for successful green infrastructure strategies and stormwater regulations. You can read the entire statement HERE but here are some of the basics:
"Widespread adoption of green infrastructure can: improve the health and livability of our communities; expand employment opportunities; reduce municipal expenses; and improve the safety, security, and sustainability of our water resources and ecosystems."
"EPA's upcoming stormwater rule should include clear, achievable, and flexible standards and provisions that encourage the adoption and use of green infrastructure practices and help advance a broader green infrastructure strategy, combining regulatory and non-regulatory tools such as financial, technical, and research-related assistance."
More specific provisions within the statement delve into the relevance of the new rule to wet-weather permits and consent decrees.
The Clean Water America Alliance is also providing green infrastructure insight through its Urban Water Sustainability Council, chaired by Kevin Shafer of the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage Department. The Council is convening a first-class leadership conference in world water hub, Milwaukee Wisconsin, October 3-5, with unique opportunities to share ideas and learn from multi-disciplinary teams from 5 cities. One is Los Angeles, a leader in green infrastructure and a winner of the 2011 U.S. Water Prize.
You can learn more about LA's green and integrated water resources works, as well as plans for the 2012 U.S. Water Prize competition, during a free one-hour webinar on August 31, hosted by the Clean Water America Alliance and Water & Wastes Digest of Scranton Gillette Communications. Learn more and register for the webinar HERE. 
These days, most gargoyles are simply ornamental grotesques and there's nothing wrong with that. However, the need for high performing tools and systems, beyond individual barrels and gardens, grows greater every day in watersheds across the country. Success is achieved and maintained through voluntary, collaborative efforts but well-crafted regulatory drivers are also needed, whether at the local, state, or federal level and whether you call them gorillas, enforcers, or green cheese. When you find the right mix at the right level, it's not only fantastic but functional too.

 "The Romans realized, as have every civilized people since, that living in cities is impossible if the water supply is not reliably clean and fresh." - Francis H. Chapelle, The Hidden Sea: Ground Water, Springs, and Wells, 1997

Seametrics Gives Shout-Outs to AWRA and Other Organizations


Time for another Shill alert!
Our Seametrics friends - the folks who build all kinds of flow measurement devices - have given AWRA a shout-out on its blog. They have been doing this for other organizations as well: California FarmWater Coalition; Soil and Water Conservation Society; American Water Works Association; and the Warden Colony.
Here is the AWRA entry:

The American Water Resources Association (AWRA) was founded in 1964 at a time in US history when water rights, management and a need for increased resources was literally changing the landscape of the country.
AWRA has stayed true to its multidisciplinary roots since its inception and continues to honor its motto of “Community, Conversation, Connections,” as the inspiration of its mission: to create a welcoming forum where people can come together and share ideas and concerns about water resource management.
“The study of water cuts across many disciplines. AWRA attracts individuals who wish to transcend the limits of their own disciplines by exploring water from other perspectives and interacting with others who desire to do the same,” stated Michael E. Campana, AWRA President.
The nongovernmental organization (NGO) pursues this mission in several ways, although perhaps most successfully through its dynamic Conference Series that attracts state, federal and foreign government representatives, specialists in a wide array of scientific and other disciplines and even laypeople with an interest in learning more about water resource management. Conferences are also often held at the state level by its 32 state sections or student chapters, which increases more immediate opportunities to personally engage in the management of local water resources.
AWRA’s commitment to partnerships has allowed it to expand well beyond the US and it frequently contributes to the improvement of water resources in areas suffering serious water crises. As AWRA approaches its 50th anniversary, it has established a presence in more than 50 foreign nations that helps members around the world network to share ideas and technological advancements across borders. Its recent agreement with the Korea Water Resources Association is a testament to the organization’s forward-looking, multidisciplinary approach to water resource management.
Researchers, scientists and specialists of all kinds also take advantage of the NGO’s two publications, the Journal of the American Water Resources Association (JAWRA) and IMPACT. Both are peer-reviewed and available to members. The former presents scholarly, applied articles on a broad spectrum of water resource issues, whereas the latter offers short, topical articles organized around a central theme.
For the public, AWRA offers to keep anyone who is interested up to date on the latest organization and water resource management news through its blog, as well as supporting and announcing public speaking engagements, training courses, award opportunities and other ways for individuals to get engaged and play an active role in protecting their most vital natural resource.

 Thanks to Charles Sipe for writing and posting this.

Announcing the Water Ethics Network and Newsletter


 David Groenfeldt, who directs the Water-Culture Institute, sent around this email announcing  the Water Ethics Network and Newsletter:

The first issue of the Water Ethics Newsletter is now posted on-line.   The Newsletter consists of one-paragraph updates of members' activities related to water ethics, with links to the details.   On the blog site, you can sign up for (free) "home delivery" of the monthly Newsletter via email, which is issued on the 15th of each month (Click on "Subscribe to our Newsletter" at the top of the right column).The Water Ethics Network has been initiated by the Water-Culture Institute along with several other organizations (listed in the Newsletter) to raise awareness and understanding about the ethics motivating water policies and practices.  The need for a new water ethic was articulated by Sandra Postel in her 1992 book, Last Oasis, and there has been much progress since then in the what, why, and how of ethics related to water.  The Water Ethics Network taps into this world of water ethics work to provide timely news about who's doing what and inspire synergies and partnerships.You are invited to participate in the Network by reading the newsletter, commenting through the blog, and, especially, by providing material for the Newsletter.  If you are involved in research, analysis, or actions that touch on the values-dimensions of water management in some way, please share what you are doing with your colleagues by sending a brief description to Network@WaterCulture.org.  The deadline to submit material for the next Newsletter is 12 September.If you might be interested in joining the Network as an organizational partner, please contact me directly.  Partnership implies substantive collaboration and can take many forms from funding to co-sponsorship of activities.Thank you for your interest in the ethical dimensions of water, and I look forward to your participation in the Network!

Here is the introductory paragraph of the inaugural issue of the newsletter:

Welcome to the first monthly issue of the Water Ethics Network Newsletter. Here we present updates from Network members as well as news about current issues dealing with ethical dimensions of water policies and practices. The Network's purpose is to raise awareness about ethical dimensions of water, promote collaboration among the members, enhance understanding, and promote the practical application of ethical concepts and perspectives. The Network is an initiative of the Water-Culture Institute in partnership with the individuals and organizations listed in the sidebar below. Anyone is welcome to subscribe to the Newsletter, and to submit news for upcoming newsletters to dgroenfeldt@waterculture.org.

Groenfeldt and his partners are to be congratulated for their initiative. The network and newsletter will prove to be important elements of the water discourse.

Aaron Wolf Videos: 1) Columbia River Treaty; 2) Basins at Risk; 3) Transboundary Basins & CC; & More!


 Todd Jarvis and others informed me of three Aaron T. Wolf videos that the Wilson Center's Environmental Change and Security Program (ECSP), headed by Geoffrey D. (Geoff) Dabelko, uploaded to itsYouTube channel. You can view all three videos at that site. Each is only about 3 to 4 minutes long but very informative.
The videos were taken from a longer program held last month at the Center, International River Basins: Mapping Institutional Resilience to Climate Change. Click on the title to see the entire 106-minute discussion. You can also download documents from Wolf and the other speakers, Jim Duncan (World Bank) and Matt Zentner (DoD), and a transcript of the entire event.
Here is the video on Columbia River: Building Resilience into the Treaty:
 
Here is the video on Updating Basins at Risk: Transboundary Water Conflict and Cooperation:
 
The final video on Transboundary Water Basins, Climate Change, Variability and Institutional Resilience:
 
Good stuff - enjoy!

Chloroquine + Too Many Committees + WaterWonkism = Sweet Dreams?


 Several weeks ago I used my weekly TGIF blog post to highlight the anti-malarial drug chloroquine, which was about to send me on an eight-week odyssey of assorted side effects.
One of the most prounounced side effects is vivid dreams, aka nightmares. Last night that reaction caught up with me.
I was in Atlanta (where I lived for a year) and was head of the National Water Quality Assessment (NAWQA) program based at EPA's Region 4. Right away, reality has taken a holiday; NAWQA is a USGS program.
Anyway, the dream was strewn with all sorts of characters from my past: classmates, co-workers, colleagues, family members, students, professors, favorite musicians, et al. I worked in a recognizable building from my Atlanta days but it was not the EPA building. I won't bore you with the details, but many of them are as clear as a bell. But I wasn't doing much but going to meetings, at which nothing significant happened.
I am thinking that I've served on too many NRC NAWQA committees (my third is winding down) and  that I think about water too much. Those, plus the chloroquine, resulted in my 'vivid dream'. But I'm unsure whether the dream was really a nightmare. Working for EPA in Atlanta? How could that be a nightmare?  
I do have an inexplicable, compelling urge to book a flight on Delta Airlines.
Sad, isn't it?
Three more pills to go.

TGIF - Tweets Galore! It's Friday, 19 August 2011 - Special Movie Edition


So what's this? Movie edition? Yes, I thought I would mention two (!!) movies I saw this week. Both were quite enjoyable and I can recommend each.
  Cowboys & Aliens may sound like a goofy premise, but it works quite well. Seems the aliens are after a precious metal. Daniel Craig, Olivia Wilde, Harrison Ford and the rest of the cast pull it off. It's a rippin' good tale, with some social commentary. Mary Frances loved it, too.
Rise of the Planet of the Apes is the prequel to the other 'Apes' movies.Well-done, folks! Good thrills and chills. The apes were something else; the scene on the  Golden Gate bridge with the apes vs. CHP and SFPD is something else. The ending leaves room for a sequel (or two), and I'm sure one is already in production.
So much for my movie reviews. Now, on to some water displacement behavior!

What's Stupid About Bottled Water?


A better title might be, 'What's Not Stupid About Bottled Water'. I found this video at EnjoyBottledWater.  It's disingenuous. Surprised?
Give it a view. 
 
The spokeswoman talks about politicians attempting to ban bottled water. She's right;  the newspaper stories they flash pertain to prohibiting bottled water at city council meetings or for staffers, not complete bans.
Then the video switches to disaster situations where the bottled water industry used some of its profits to provide water. That's nice. I don't think politicians would refer to the use of bottled water in such situations as 'stupid', 'wasteful' or 'reckless'. But use of bottled water is stupid when you have perfectly good tap water available.
As for EPA recommending bottled water for people with compromised immune systems, get the complete story here. 
As for Hidell-Eyster, the firm that spokesmanWilliam Hidell heads, it consults for the bottled water industry.
And while we're at it - so what's so good about goodbye? Apologies to purists - here's the original.
"You know what's stupid about bottled water? It's﻿ stupid that Americans are buying their own water that companies get for free. It has nothing to do with the environment and everything to do with common sense. Some bottled waters cost as much as $9 per gallon! What kind of an idiot pays that much for water?" - comment on the YouTube site.


"Of course it's not "wasteful and stupid" to drink bottled water in the face of a disaster or water contamination. That's NOT what the politicians are referring to. The issue is not wasting water, it's wasting the plastic that bottled water comes in. Even though they are recyclable, the majority of people (just ask, or look, around) will NOT recycle. Plus, plastic bottles are NOT safe to reuse. Heated, they release elements of BPA, toxins that are leaked into the next liquid put in the﻿ bottle." - comment on the YouTube site.

A Sad Commentary Indeed: Drinking Water in Schools


The following commentary from Rita Sudman of the Water Education Foundation was posted a few days ago on  Aquafornia. It's about providing free drinking water in schools.
With all due respect to Sudman: is this pathetic or what? We used to have this 'problem' solved - 55 years ago when I was in grammar school. There were things called 'water fountains' in schools! Amazing devices! Here is a picture of one. 
It's sad that she has to comment on this. 
Read what she has to say:

 A few months ago, I wrote about a law that requires California schools to provide free drinking water in cafeterias. The new state law took effect July 1 but the law allows schools districts to opt out of the law if they adopt a resolution stating they can’t afford to comply with it. A new federal law also takes effect in September and will require school districts to make water available to all children who are part of the National School Lunch Program. Water is not a reimbursable beverage from the federal government – like milk – and some school administrators are calling the state and federal laws “unfunded mandates.” If water was a reimbursable beverage, probably many schools would look more favorably at the federal law. Additionally, schools get revenue from vending machines providing soda and bottled water.
It’s clear that school children need opportunities to drink more water. Only 15 percent of middle school children consume adequate amounts of water according to the Center for Disease Control’s (CDC) National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Actually the CDC says that, since children spend a large percent of their waking hours at school, they should be consuming at least half their total water intake there. Even mild dehydration can affect learning, mental alertness and physical performance in children.
 Researchers at the UCLA/RAND Center for Adolescent Health Promotion have been testing a way to encourage school children to drink more water. This program includes free cups and five gallon jugs for five schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District. Researchers say the program is a success. However, it’s now up to the school district to continue funding it. Los Angeles Unified says the cost to implement the program for the entire district would be $1.8 million to $2.3 million annually and is, therefore, too expensive.
Why don’t children just bring water to school in refillable bottles? The reason often is that many schools don’t allow children to bring liquids into their schools, fearing something harmful may have been put in the container. In Germany children are allowed to fill reusable water bottles at school and store them there.
One possibility for U.S. schools could be the new water filling stations. In San Francisco, the city’s Public Utilities Commission is funding the installation of five tap water filling stations in five schools now followed by more stations later. A Commission spokesperson says they are connecting children to their water supply and thus their watershed. The plan is to build up the next generation’s confidence in tap water and teach children to value their water supply. The Commission is looking to local nonprofits and other funding sources for the installations beyond these five schools. In other parts of California and the West, partnerships between local school districts and local water districts could increase the availability and appreciation of tap water for the emerging generation of citizens. Why not Adopt a School in your local area?
 

I do applaud Sudman but I find the necessity for her comments unfortunate. Put the drinking fountains back in schools and use good old-fashioned tap water. And make sure they can fill water bottles.
Sometimes the old ways are the best ways.
"By polluting clear water with slime you will never find good drinking water."  - Aeschylus

Singapore: Temasek Foundation Water Leadership Programme Scholarships 


This looks like an excellent opportunity for people in certain Asian countries (see map). 

 The Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy (LKY School) is pleased to launch the Temasek   Foundation Water Leadership Programme (TFWLP) which will commence from 10–21 October 2011. The programme is developed by the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy (LKY School), NUS in collaboration with Temasek Foundation and PUB, Singapore’s national water agency.
 The TFWLP aims to meet the needs of policymakers and leaders within both public and private water utilities that are trying to cope with the various challenges ranging from institutional, regulatory, and financial aspects of delivering water and sanitation. It will expose participants to case studies on good practices in water utilities governance, practical guidance on effectively managing water utilities, and potential strategies to deal with current and future challenges. Designed for middle and upper level managers in local regional or national water utilities, the programme is also highly relevant to policymakers, public utilities officials, consultants, researchers and representatives of civil society who are concerned with the governance of water utilities in their countries. Each team should ideally be composed of 3-4 from a public utility agency, 1-2 national government representatives, and 1-2 private or not-for-profit representatives (NGO’s) from one country. Designations could range from Chairman, Chief Executive Officers, Directors, Deputy Directors, Managers, consultants or researchers etc.  
Full tuition expenses and hotel accommodation will be covered by the Temasek Foundation for the successful applicant. Lunch, tea breaks and transportation to and from the programme venue and hotel will be provided daily.  Participants eligible for scholarships are expected to source and fund for their own airfares and per diem. More information may be found in the brochure and application form on our website.
 Please note that the deadline for submission has been extended to 27 August 2011.
 To apply, kindly enclose your team applicants’ resume or curriculum vitae with the application form and send it to: Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, National University of Singapore469C Bukit Timah RoadOei Tiong Ham BuildingSingapore 259772 Attention: Luana Chow                 Assistant Manager                 Executive Education, Level 3                 Temasek Foundation Water Leadership Programme

New Book: 'Reining in the Rio Grande: People, Land, and Water'


 I just learned from friend Elaine Hebard that Reining in the Rio Grande: People, Land, and Water, has been published by the University of New Mexico Press. The authors are Fred Phillips, G. Emlen (Em) Hall, and Mary Black.
Phillips is the world-renowned hydrologist who heads the hydrology program at New Mexico Tech. Black has has worked as an anthropological linguist, editor/writer, and librarian for the University of Arizona and as editor of Southwest Hydrology. Hall (shown below) is an Emeritus Professor of Law at the University of New Mexico and a former colleague of mine. Hall also wrote the acclaimed High and Dry: The Texas-New Mexico Struggle for the Pecos River.
From the book's WWW site:

The Rio Grande was ancient long before the first humans reached its banks. These days, the  highly regulated river looks nothing like it did to those early settlers. Alternately viewed as a valuable ecosystem and life-sustaining foundation of community welfare or a commodity to be engineered to yield maximum economic benefit, the Rio Grande has brought many advantages to those who live in its valley but the benefits have come at a price.
This study examines human interactions with the Rio Grande from prehistoric time to the present day and explores what possibilities remain for the desert river. From the perspectives of law, development, tradition, and geology, the authors weigh what has been gained and lost by reining in the Rio Grande.
 

Enjoy! “Until I came to New Mexico, I never realized how much beauty water adds to a river.” – Mark Twain

Are We Drinking Dinosaur Pee or Not?


 Much has has been made of several recent statements that we are indeed drinking 'dinosaur pee' because the same water that is around today was around then as well. 
So are we drinking dinosaur pee? If you want to cut to the chase, scroll down to the bottom. Otherwise, brace yourself.
On page 16 of  The Big Thirst (read my review), Charles Fishman starts discussing the 'resiliency' of water and then on page 17 suggests we are drinking dinosaur pee because the water molecules that are around today have been around for at least for the past few hundred million years  - 'No water is being created or destroyed on Earth' (page 17). Another book, The Future of Water: A Startling Look Ahead , by Steve Maxwell and Scott Yates, states:  

The water that dinosaurs drank is the same water we drink today, and the amount of water in the world is the same, too. Fossil fuels get burned and are gone forever. Water remains.

In response to her publishing of this quote in an email to the AWRA membership,AWRA Director of Marketing Mary Ashton received this thoughtful response from a reader who is a water researcher with outstanding credentials:

 This is a common and widespread mis-perception that greatly detracts from much more important messages regarding water. This fallacy only serves to perpetuate a very common misunderstanding regarding a concept central to the water cycle. This misunderstanding is a major cause of public rejection of recycled water. It also has ramifications regarding the public's understanding of the ecological services provided by nature and why they are important.Discussions of drinking water (and water re-use) often involve the water cycle. A common notion is that water is essentially "immutable" or "old". Journalists and even many scientists have been fond of painting a picture of the water cycle that is grossly over-simplified and incorrect.  At the heart of the matter is the notion that the world's water today is the same water that existed long ago - such as when the dinosaurs roamed!This mis-portrayal of the water cycle has played an important but hidden role in the reticence of the public in accepting water re-use. The myth of the "constancy" of water - - the purported never-ending recycling of water itself - - is itself a major cause for consumer rejection of water recycling projects. Our traditional concept of the water "cycle" is inherently flawed.In reality, NEW water is being continually created by myriad biophysicochemical processes. As such, water can be viewed as being constantly "refreshed" or "rejuvenated."  Common examples are the creation of new water (such as from thenumerous oxidative or combustion processes; one visible example is water vapor created by combustion of jet fuel - contrails), and the "destruction" of water (a common exmaple is the hydration of lime that occurs when cement sets). The O-H bonds in water are continually being broken and reformed.
Water is an extremely reactive chemical. Any particular "single" water molecule (composed of the exact same particular atoms of hydrogen and oxygen) is constantyl involved in numerous fast, dynamic processes; note, however, that the notion of a particular "single" molecule is rather elusive to pin down (but this notion is necsssary in order to believe in the notion of  "old" water). These molecules are continually involved not just in continual rearrangement of water clusters and hydrogen bonding (which doesn't necessarily involve bond breakage), but also in autoionization (disocciating to form the hydronium ion H3O+ and the hydroxide ion OH-) and in countless numbers of reactions catalyzed by enzymes, eventually leading to the ubiquitous incorporation of oxygen and hydrogen into the universe of organic molecules(followed by the inevitable release as water).
The bond breakage and formation that continually occurs in water 'clusters' occurs at the pico-second scale. The notion of single, defined "molecules" of water is probably conceptual only - and their existence would be extraordinarily brief.
 This is very important - becuase understanding that water is continually being formed anew serves to better inform the public about perceived risks - an important aspect in oversoming the so-called "yuck factor" that many authors devote considerable discussion to. But it could also serve to show the public one of the values of ecosystems - "rejuvenating" water. This undoubtedly played a major role in the original naming of Singapore's water reuse project (themost dvanced in the world), which produces water that exceeds drinking water standards directly from sewage. Their facility was aptly named NEWater.
 The risk perception problem (in the case of water reuse) is not necessarily driven by what's in it, but rather from the mythical "memory" that water is believed to possess. "Old" water is presumed to possess an ummitbake memnory of its past (such as sewage). Even when ultra-purified resued water can be certified as being much purer than municipal drinking water available from the tap, the fear derives from its past- not its present state.

I have to admit that after 40+ years of studying water (including a large part of the time involved in dating groundwater), I had not thought very much about the 'dinosaur pee" argument. In fact, I  first recall hearing one form of it last fall at the PGWI Conference from Dr. Robert Giegengack (access his presentation at the PGWI site) although he cast it in the form of drinking water that passed through Moses - he proposed that there were 40,000 'Moses molecules' per 8 ounce glass of water. His presentation aslso contains some interesting estimates of the toal number of water molecules.
 To accept the 'dinosaur pee' statement, we must believe two critical elements: 1) the amount of water in the hydrological cycle has remained more or less constant since the time of the dinosaurs (if not longer); and 2) water molecules last forever.
I accept the former but reject the latter. I know that water molecules do not necesssarily last forever. Even in a glass of water at room temperature, some water molecules 'autodissociate' into H+ and OH- (or more accurately, H3O+ and OH-) ions. Water is also 'created' and 'destroyed' by a variety of biogeophysicochemical reactions. And recall that water is H2O and nothing else; when water breaks down into its ionic components, it's not water any longer.  But those ions will eventually recombine back into water, only to dissociate again. So can we consider the water as being 'the same' if the individual molecules have been continually breaking down and reforming?
And just how long does an indvidual water molecule last? I confess to ignorance. A cursory electronic search on the 'lifetime of a water molecule' or 'half-life of a water moelcule' (excluding water molecules comprised of the radioactive form of hydrogen, tritium) yielded no useful results. The thoughtful reader suggest a picosecond scale. Not very long!
My take: So are we drinking dinosaur pee? Yes and no.
No: If you are a 'purist' (poor word choice in this case - maybe 'anal retentive' is preferable) and insist that the water moelcules have to be exactly the same and not have dissociated and reformed many times in the intervening scores of millions of years, then the answer is 'No!"
Yes: If you are easy-going and just require that the H's and O's are the same although they may have dissociated and recombined since the time of the dinosaurs, then the answer is 'Yes!'
By the way, take note of the the final two paragraphs of the responder's message - the connection between 'dinosaur pee' and the 'yuck factor'. Well said.
This has been quite an effort - much ado about nothing?  I think I will get a glass of tap water, then rest.

Dewatering the Desert: SNWA Pipeline Project EIS Comments Accepted Till 11 October 2011


 The Draft EIS for the SNWA's pipeline project, aka 'Las Vegas Water Grab' , 'Patty's Pipe', and a few other things I can't mention here, is out and the BLM has announced that it will extend the public comment period until 11 october 2011.
Access the document and information here. Here is an overview. And here is the whole enchilada.
Steve Erickson, Utah Coordinator of the Great Basin Water Network (GBWN) had a recent Op-Ed about the project in the Salt Lake Tribune (thanks to Emily Green for enlightening me).
The final two paragraphs of Erickson's piece are below. He invokes the infamous MX missile, which I remember well. And check out the 1994 quote from Mulroy in the final paragraph.

Thirty years ago, the Great Basin was under a huge threat from the proposed MX missile deployment. Public opposition defeated MX and can stop the water grab, too. Learn more about the water grab, visit the GBWN website www.greatbasinwater.net, comment on the draft impact statement, contact your Congress members and senators. Tell the BLM to protect the public trust resources under its management by selecting the No Action Alternative and denying the pipeline right of way.
SNWA General Manager Pat Mulroy once called this pipeline the “singularly most stupid idea anyone ever had” (High Country News, 1994). Let’s help her and Las Vegas find a smarter, more sustainable water future.

Here is the GBWN's 'Water Grab EIS Guide'     Download GBWN-EIS-Guide-07-25-2011
Happy reading and commenting!
Now I can get back to reading emails from a fellow who's scheming to bring Mississippi River water to the desert, a project that would make 'Pat's Pipe' look like a soda straw. 
It never ends.

Guidelines for Constructing Climate Scenarios


In October 2009 the Oregon Climate Change Research Institute (OCCRI) organized a workshop on scenarios of future climate (details of the workshop are here). Here is the publication (from a recent issue of Eos) resulting from that workshop:

El Agua Es Vida en Honduras y Todo El Mundo


 
 The title's translation: 'Water is life in Honduras and the whole world'.
Yesterday was my last full day in Honduras. It was quite surprising and incredibly satisfying.
 
Rolando López and I drove to the municipality (similar to a county) of Omoa, on the Caribbean coast. The municipality starts about 30 miles from, and extends to, the Guatemala border. From there we went to the village of Brisas de Rio Cuyamel, just a stone's throw from the border. Last December I posted about the village, where the Ann Campana Judge Foundation had funded and built a potable water system for the community of about 130 people. The project was significant because it was the first project the ACJF had funded and completed on its own. Usually, we support other organizations. 
The vista looks northwest from the village. Guatemala is in the background and the Caribbean Sea is just out of the view to the right. 
 
 Unbeknownst to me, the villagers, mainly the students, put together a program consisting of a number of short sketches. They were amazing; humor, morality, domestic violence, sobriety, and other slivers from everyday life were addressed. But the emphasis was on the importance of water, as the sign illustrates.
Some pictures follow. I will put the rest on my Facebook page (Michael Campana).
Click on the thumbnails to enlarge. This little one is 'La Gotita' - the little drop. She was a reluctant subject, but finally smiled after I took the picture. We had clowns. And drunks! Even ghosts!
 


﻿  
 
 

Here is the plaque the village gave me. The bottle contains water from the system. It will travel with me to the USA and sit in my office, along with the plaque.
 Below is a picture of me and some of the villagers with 'el tanque'. The villagers want to build a new school near the tank, on land they own. The current school is dilapidated and also on leased land. It must be relocated soon. I am going to help them find funds to purchase the lumber, probably about $2,000 - $3,000. They will have to do a little 'earth moving' to make the land  suitable for the school.
 After the tank photo was taken we had a wonderful lunch of tortillas, rice, and chicken soup.
Quite a day, but it was not over yet. Rolando and I drove back to San Pedro Sula to meet the mayor of Omoa, Prof. Ricardo Alvarado, who was in SPS for a meeting. I did not realize it but he was going to present me with a certificate of appreciation for my efforts with 'los sistemas de agua potable' in his municipality. I have been involved in six such projects, including Brisas de Cuyamel.
 Imagine my surprise and joy when he presented me with the certificate in the lobby of the Hotel Gran Sula, and then brought in a film crew from a local TV station. He spoke with them and then the reporter interviewed me, during which I spoke in broken Spanish.
We asked the mayor to help Brisas de Cuyamel with the school project by providing a municipal front-loader to help prepare the land. He promised that he would. 'Give me a month,' he said. Rolando said the mayor was a man of his word. The villagers will be pleased. Now, for the wood.
All in all, a wonderful end to a great trip, made possible by amigo Rolando López and others. I will have a lot to think about during today's flight home and the ensuing days, weeks, and months.
Sometimes it takes a while to realize which things are really important in your life. What I saw and experienced today and during the past week is one of them. At 63, I am finally there.
"So often times it happens that we live our lives in chains, and we never even know we have the key." -- Already Gone by The Eagles (1974), written by Jack Tempchin and Bob Strandlund

Lloyd G. Carter: Budgets, Billionaires, Bonds, Big Profits and the Brown Family, Part 2


As promised, here is Part 2 of the two-part series by Patrick Porgans and Lloyd G. Carter. Here is Part 1. The Editor's Note follows.

Editor’s Note: In Part One of this two-part series, Porgans and Carter showed how land-rich but water-short Southern California billionaires are pushing an $11 billion bond measure on the 2012 ballot to enhance their holdings.  Part Two examines the legacy of Gov. Edmund G. “Pat” Brown and his two children, current Gov. Edmund G. “Jerry” Brown and Kathleen Brown, and their connection to public bonds, budget deficits, the Bay-Delta Estuary conflict, and the November 2012 water bond measure

Enjoy!
Well, maybe not.
“We were questioning could we pass a bond act of $1.75 billion? We didn’t know exactly the cost of the project. We hadn’t priced it out to any exactitude.  As a matter of fact, we thought it would cost more than the $1.75 billion, probably in the neighborhood of $2.5 billion.” -- former Gov. Edmund G. 'Pat' Brown (D-CA), referring to the State Water Project, in a 1979 interview (from the Porgans-Carter article).

WaterWired Book Review: Charles Fishman's 'The Big Thirst'



Finally! Time for your dose of my stream-of-consciousness book review writing. Nice catchy post title, too. And people wonder when I tell them I could not write a book. Here goes...
When Charles Fishman’s publisher sent me a free copy of The Big Thirst: The Secret Life and Turbulent Future of Water (aka TBT) almost four (!) months ago, there were two things I could not imagine, that: 1) it would take me so long to read and review the book; and 2) I’d be writing the review in Honduras, while on a hydrophilanthropic mission. People die in this country from malaria, cholera, dysentery, and dengue – afflictions virtually unknown to those of us in the developed world.As for (1). Fishman’s book was not at all hard to read, but my reading vision problem again reared its ugly head. As for (2), I am certain that my location will color my review, and that is appropriate.I’m starting this review in La Ceiba, a city on Honduras’ northern (Caribbean) coast, which bills itself as the gateway to the Bay Islands, La Mosquitia and the country’s party city – like New Orleans is in the USA. But it’s not the partying I’m contemplating; it’s the fact that the municipal water in the place where I’m staying is unavailable between about 4 PM and 5:30 AM each day and when  it’s on, you don’t drink it.  These are two facts of life in Honduras and many other countries.  The first thing I did when I disembarked in San Pedro Sula was buy a reputable brand of bottled water. If that fails, I’ve got my little bottle of chlorine bleach. And my Imodium A-D.My main reason for being in Honduras is investigating potential drinking water projects for my students and foundation. But it just prompts me to tell my readers -- in the developed world anyway – be thankful for the water you have emanating from your tap, and to my friends in the USA, you’re not paying nearly enough.But enough about me.
******Short story I thoroughly enjoyed Fishman’s book. It’s well-researched and well-written, with extensive notes. Fishman works for the business magazine Fast Company and the book reflects, but is not dominated by, a business perspective.
TBT’s opening paragraph really piqued my curiosity. In it, Fishman describes the launch of the space shuttle from Cape Canaveral and the huge amount of water – 300,000 gallons - required for the launch. Sure, you say – as a heat sink and flame suppressant.  But no, Fishman says, those are not the reasons; it is something else the water provides. And I’m not going to tell you, but it is something I did not know. Certainly a different way to start a water book.He eloquently describes our complex relationship with water – we love to play in it, look at it, listen to it, desire it, but undervalue (in an economic sense) it and fuss when we think we are paying a water bill that is too high. Yet we pay outlandishly high prices for bottled water, which, in most cases, is an absolute frivolity. We forget how essential good tap water is to public health. We have let our water infrastructure deteriorate to the point where some fear that those wealthy enough will walk away from our tap water and switch to the bottled stuff. Water has become invisible.And there are numbers – lotsa numbers! So many gigaliters for this, so many megaliters for that, etc. But Fishman does an exemplary job illustrating how much water is actually represented by those  large numbers with strange units. He even has a list of conversion factors  and water facts in the back. So some might be put off by the numbers, especially the unfamiliar units, but not I.
 We are regaled with water’s secret life. Where it came from – not from planet Earth. The is fact that most of Earth’s water is locked up in rocks and minerals deep beneath our feet. In my late 1960s Stone-Aged petrology and mineralogy classes my instructor, Dr. Steve Clement, referred to that as ‘water of crystallization’ or some such. It really is not a fourth state of water but I understand why Fishman uses that expression.So Fishman’s description of water’s secret life, whether it is ensconced far beneath the surface involved in tectonic processes, in some far-off galaxy, or as an ultrapure compound (courtesy of IBM) that tastes horribly bitter and is a ferociously hungry beast, was welcomed by me. There’s more to water than something from the tap or as a carrier of our waste.
Another interminable aside: when I first taught hydrogeology in 1976 I started using the legendary George Burke Maxey’s notes and was astounded to find about 20 or so different terms for subsurface water, a few of which described the deep water Fishman discusses. I think those terms came from O.E. Meinzer’s tome, Hydrology. But Burke had been trained as a paleontologist/stratigrapher, (joke from one of my geology profs: Q: What’s the difference between stamp collecting and paleontology? A: Stamp collecting is actually useful.) so terminology and categorization reigned supreme. But I chucked those words and went straight to the well hydraulics, written in a language I knew – mathematics.
 Some short cuts
Things I liked or that otherwise made an impression on me:
1) The terms ‘water envy’, ‘water poverty’ and ‘ostentatious water’. The last one? You got it – Vegas, baby!
2) A tale of two Aussie cities: Perth and Toowoomba. One had a visionary water manager who recognized nonstationarity and successfully tackled water shortages whereas in the other, a tough-minded mayor tried to shove a water policy down its citizens’ throats.
3) A tale of two USA cities: Las Vegas and Atlanta. Two growth monsters, but the former had Pat Mulroy as ‘water czarina’, and visionary, the latter, no such persona.4) India – that rising, high-tech economy, the folks who debug our computers, yet don’t provide 24/7 clean water to its residents and pollutes its sacred rivers. I still don’t really understand, but I now sort of see they do what they do (or don’t) do what they do. But Indians also have some innovative, grassroots aquifer recharge projects.
5) Las Vegas and its effort to stretch its ‘meager’ Colorado River supply to accommodate more residents. Interesting contrast: a place characterized by opulence, excess, and conspicuous consumption, yet trying to conserve water. That’s why Fishman doesn’t talk about conservation in places such as Tucson or Albuquerque – because, they’re…well, not Vegas!6) Australia as a harbinger: “a gift to the rest of the developed world.” Will we look it in the mouth?7) GE getting into water purification in a big way, yet dragging its feet regarding its contamination of the Hudson River with PCBs. Charity begins at home, folks.8) Water economist Mike Young
9) Aussie rice farmers in the Murray-Darling basin, growing rice in an arid region.10) Great notes!
11) Galveston, oh, Galveston - not the Glen Campbell song, but Hurricane Ike.
12) Evian facial mister? $427/gallon. WTF?
13) Water experts I'd never heard of - great!14) Pat Mulroy quotes: “People don’t understand water.” And, referring to the folks in the North American Great Lakes region,“They’ve got 14% of the population of the United States, and 20% of the fresh water in the world [Oh, no, Pat!] – and no one can use it but them? ‘I might not need it. But I’m not sharing it.’ When did it become their water anyway? It’s nuts!”I think Mulroy doesn’t understand people. Talk to the rural folks in Nevada and western Utah who would be impacted by her massive groundwater pumping scheme; see if they understand water [Forgive the editorial comment.] Some issues
Early on (page 19) , Fishman makes the statement “All water problems are local.” He almost immediately qualifies that by saying that it’s not quite so simple as that, and even later states that water problems are local or regional. That’s getting better. Are the water quality problems in the Lower Mississippi River local or regional? Will a decrease in wheat production in the southern High Plains because of declining groundwater supplies cause Saudi Arabia to use more of its groundwater to grow wheat that it might have imported from the USA? He’s right, it’s not that simple.
 Privatization. I was surprised that there was no mention of this, despite the fact that Fishman is a business reporter. Corporations are well represented but not in the water or wastewater system privatization discussion. A lot of people are concerned about this issue. Yet I do not recall his discussion of this, or people like Maude Barlow and Vandana Shiva and their proponents.
Note added on 13 August 2011: On page 16, Fishman starts discussing the 'resiliency' of water and then on page 17 suggests we are drinking dinosaur pee because the water molecules that are around today have been around for at least for the past few hundred million years - 'No water is being created or destroyed on Earth' (page 17). But an individual water molecule is not 'eternal'; the strong covalent bonds binding the oxygen to the two hydrogens can be broken by photodisocciation and biogeochemical reactions, to be reformed when OH- and H+ combine. Even the so-called misnamed 'fourth state of water' deep within Earth that Fishman discusses is not really water, which is H2O, but likely occurs as OH- and H+. So I have to think about the 'dinosaur pee' argument, which has been heard elsewhere as well. I first heard one form of it last fall at the PGWI Conference from Dr. Robert Giegengack (access his presentation at the PGWI site) although he cast it in the form of drinking water that passed through Moses. Here's my assessment.
Bottom lineGreat book; highly recommended. If you haven't read it, you need to, WaterWonk or not.
It actually had the opposite effect on me than what I feared. I thought this book would further add to my water-book burnout. But it has actually whetted my appetite for other water books: Cynthia Barnett's is due next month, then there is David Zetland's to read on the flights home, plus Alex Prud'homme's The Ripple Effect, Will Sarni's Corporate Water Strategies, and Brian Fagan's Elixir. I may even tackle Tom Swihart's Florida's Water.
It will be very nice to see and hear Barnett, Fishman, and Zetland at the AWRA November meeting.
Too many water books, too little time.
Gotta get this thing out the door!

 "I think our relationship with water is going to be one of the deciding things of the next century. I don't think water's in trouble. But we might be." -- Dr. Richard Wolfenden
"I think petroleum is better managed than water. With all its ugliness, at least it works." - Mike Young
"Nothing says indulgence, in fact, like paying for something you don't need to pay for, like paying for something you don't need." -- Charles Fishman, referring to bottled water

Positions: 1) Senior VP of Global Ops, Living Water; 2) ED, Interstate Commission, Potomac River Basin


These two positions caught my eye. Each is a little different from the run-of-the-mill position vacancies.
1) The Living Water position is with an excellent, Christian hydrophilanthropy based in the Houston area. I used to volunteer with them as a hand-pump repair instructor and I still support them financially - personally and through the Ann Campana Judge Foundation.
Here is a link to the description  (if you use IE you'll need add-ons enabled)) and a downloadable executive summary.

JAWRA August 2011 Highlights


 From the AWRA blog.

The Journal of the American Water Resources Association (JAWRA) is dedicated to publishing original papers characterized by their broad approach to water resources issues. Water by its nature is complex. Therefore, effectively managing water resources requires a broad understanding of many concepts and their applications, as plans based on a single outlook – only engineering, only biology, only ecomonics, or only law – tend to have unhappy outcomes. Decisions makers addressing water resources challenges require access to high quality science and research presented from a variety of perspectives. JAWRA has been focused on this objective for more than 40 years.
August 2011 – Volume 47, Issue 4
Viers argues future long-term fixed licenses of hydropower operation will be ill prepared to adapt if science-based approaches to incorporating reasonable and foreseeable hydrologic changes into study plans are not included. view abstract »
Dosskey and Qiu compare indexes for placing water quality buffers in agricultural watersheds. view abstract »
Tsai et al. assessed impacts on water use achieved by implementation of controlled experiments relating to four water conservation strategies in four towns within the Ipswich watershed in Massachusetts. view abstract »
Gray et al. report millennial-length reconstructions of Upper Colorado River basin streamflow show marked interannual variability imbedded in nonstationary behavior over decadal to multidecadal time scales. view abstract »
Mayer and Naman examine the regional streamflow response in 25 predominately unregulated basins to warmer winter temperatures and snowpack reductions over the last half century in the Klamath Basin of California and Oregon. view abstract »
Davies-Colley et al. describe New Zealand’s National Rivers Water Quality Network, now in its third decade of monitoring. view abstract »
Andrews et al. describe a project to restore a native riparian corridor in Kentucky with giant cane and bottomland forest species. view abstract »
Rosenquist et al. report on a study to test the efficacy of rejuvenating the phosphorus retention of constructed wetlands in the field. view abstract »
Kang and Lee describe development of the Water Resources Sustainability Evaluation Model, which employs four criteria (economic efficiency, social equity, environmental conservation, and maintenance capacity) and has 16 indicators. view abstract »
Snelder et al. describe a method for assessing hydrological rules of thumb that describes their consequences for protection of the ecosystem (in terms of retention of physical habitat) and the reliability of the water resource. view abstract »
Vadas et al. investigate the effect of the time between manure application and the first rain-runoff event as a practice to reduce runoff P loss. view abstract »

"Associations do so many things so well, but one of the very best is also one of the least often emphasized. You may never have seen a membership promotion brochure that says 'you are going to meet many, many new people and from your contacts you will expand your horizons, develop a wider view of the world, make life-long friends, and discover the essential thread that unites the human race.'” -- Elissa Myers, former ASAE staffer (thanks to Ken Reid).

Lloyd G. Carter: Budgets, Billionaires, Bonds, Big Profits and the Brown Family, Part 1


Even in Honduras I can't escape the sharp mind of Lloyd G. Carter. Here is the first of a two-part piece from Carter and Patrick Porgans.
And check out this wonderful Delta quote:
 "A study of fish populations in the Delta is currently being carried out by the Department of Water Resources and the Department of Fish and Game to determine the causes of declining fish populations, as well as some possible solutions to this problem.  Proponents of SB 200 believe that these studies, as well as the provided for improved fish screens, will be adequate to protect Delta Fish populations." --- State Bar Committee on the Environment analysis of SB 200, a ballot measure which would have granted the state authority to build a peripheral canal around the Delta, June 1982 (thanks to Lloyd G. Carter)

TGIF - Tweets Galore! It's Friday, 5 August 2011 - Special 'The Sky Above,The Mud Below' Edition


 Why not Honduras? That's where Rolando López and I are, keeping one step ahead of the rainy season. It was a chore getting this post out the door. 
A shout-out goes to our Toyota 4-Runner for getting us over the mountains, across the rivers and lagoons, around the rocks, and through the  mud.
 I'm reminded of the 1961 movie, The Sky Above, The Mud Below - hence  the blog post title.
And when we visited the dusty town of Dulce Nombre de Culmi, I recalled Don Henley's All She Wants to Do Is Dance, although no guerrillas were in sight.
But as I texted Mary Frances, I am 'sucio pero feliz;'- 'dirty but happy'. Looks like some good WatSan projects.
 So enjoy the pictures and the displacement behavior offered below.

Pearls Before Swine? Age Before Beauty? Words of Wisdom from Steve D.


What's up with 'Pearls Before Swine' and 'Age Before Beauty'? Nothing really, it just sounded catchy.
Not sure who Steve D. is.
Got this from Katharine Hayhoe.

A few general rules from an actual card-carrying scientist, courtesy Steve D. You're the man, Steve! Read on ...1. If you argue against climate forecasts by saying we can’t predict the weather two weeks ahead, you are utterly unqualified to be in the debate. If you don’t know the difference between weather and climate, go take an intro class on meteorology. (Hint: it’s a little like micro- versus macro-economics)2. Anything you get off a blog or the popular media is worthless. If you can’t refer to the actual scientific literature – real journals, not the bogus ones started by denialists – you don’t have any qualifications to join the debate.3. NASA said it would go to the Moon and did. NASA said it would build a space shuttle and did. NASA says climate data is showing the earth getting warmer. And you have accomplished…?4. Anything by the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine is a joke. The vast majority of the people who signed their Petition are not climate researchers.5. TV meteorologists are not climate scientists.6. “Arrogant” is a favorite buzzword to dismiss real authorities, whether they’re climatologists, evolutionary scientists, or 9-11 debunkers. Speaking from a position of expertise is not arrogance. Speaking from a position of zero expertise is.7. Scientists are not “self-appointed experts.” They are real experts. The “self-appointed experts” are the people who think they can read a couple of blogs or Jack Chick tracts and enter a technical debate as equals.

According to (2), you shouldn't believe this because it's from a blog. So I guess we're back at aquare one.
On the other hand, I give you this quote:
 “With the possible exception of Tiger Woods, nothing has had a worse year than global warming. We have discovered that a good portion of the science used to justify “climate change” was a hoax perpetrated by leftist ideologues with an agenda.” —Todd Young, new congressman from Indiana

William deBuys: 'A Great Aridness: Climate Change and the Future of the American Southwest' 


 Just received some information about William deBuys' new book, A Great Aridness: Climate Change and the Future of the American Southwest.
Here is the marketing copy:

With its soaring azure sky and stark landscapes, the American Southwest is one of the most hauntingly beautiful regions on earth. Yet staggering population growth, combined with the intensifying effects of climate change, is driving the oasis-based society close to the brink of a Dust-Bowl-scale catastrophe.In "A Great Aridness," William deBuys paints a compelling picture of what the Southwest might look like when the heat turns up and the water runs out. This semi-arid land, vulnerable to water shortages, rising temperatures, wildfires, and a host of other environmental challenges, is poised to bear the heaviest consequences of global environmental change in the United States. Examining interrelated factors such as vanishing wildlife, forest die backs, and the over-allocation of the already stressed Colorado River--upon which nearly 30 million people depend--the author narrates the landscape's history--and future. He  tells the inspiring stories of the climatologists and others who are helping untangle the complex, interlocking causes and effects of global warming. And while the fate of this region may seem at first blush to be of merely local interest, what happens in the Southwest, deBuys suggests, will provide a glimpse of what other mid-latitude arid lands worldwide--the Mediterranean Basin, southern Africa, and the Middle East--will experience in the coming years. Written with an elegance that recalls the prose of John McPhee and Wallace Stegner, "A Great Aridness" offers an unflinching look at the dramatic effects of climate change occurring right now in our own backyard.

deBuys is an exceptional writer, and if this is anything like his previous works, then it will be something special.
Too many books, too little time. But I'll make time.
“In apocalyptic visions of global climate change, the North American Southwest makes an easy protagonist, the geographical equivalent of a stalled car on railroad tracks with a speeding train approaching.” -- William deBuys

Honduras Hydrophilanthropy Hiatus: WaterWired Heads South


 I may miss some daily posts for the first time in 3.5 years as I'll be taking somewhat of a 'vacation' from today through 11 August.
I am heading down to Honduras to investigate some potential WatSan projects for two students and for the Ann Campana Judge Foundation. I also hope to see at least one project the ACJF funded - the Brisas de Cuyamel project (tank shown here).
Good friend Rolando López and I will head north and east out of San Pedro Sula to the  coastal city of La Ceiba, and then we will head south ( inland) to visit some villages in the remote interior of the country. I'll be in areas devoid of Internet and cell coverage.
But I'll be back!

AMOS: POU Water Filtration, Capacity Building, and Hygiene Education in Nicaragua  


Since I posted on simple manual drill rigs yesterday I've obviously got 'water on the brain'. Must be my impending trip to Honduras.
Robert Adamski sent this link to a video on drinking water production in a Nicaraguan village using simple point-of-use biosand filtration. The short (just < 5 minutes) video shows AMOS Health and Hope instructing Nicaraguan villagers on biosand filters and hygiene.
What I like about the video is the emphasis on building capacity/stakeholder involvement and hygiene education.
The filter containers themselves look a little flimsy.
 
Here is a blurb about AMOS from the You Tube site:

AMOS Health and Hope is a Christian non-profit dedicated to improving the health of poor and marginalized rural populations in Nicaragua. AMOS trains lay health workers in these rural communities to manage and run their own community clinic, prevent and treat the most common illnesses, and work in community development to address the root causes of poor health such as access to safe water and sanitation. This video reflects our water filter program.
We currently serve a population of over 13,000 people in 27 communities in four departments in Nicaragua -- Boaco, Chinandega, Matagalpa, and the RAAS. We have two medical teams that accompany, supervise and monitor the health work being done in rural communities. We are committed to implementing interventions that are evidence-based, compassionate and empowering for communities.

"A generous person will be enriched and one who gives water will get water." -- Proverbs 11:25

BYU's Human-Powered Water Well Drill Rig; Terry Waller's Method


Gilles Wendling of GW Solutions, Inc. sent me information about a human-powered drill rig developed by BYU engineering students.
 
 Here is a test of the rig in Tanzania.
  
 Here is more information via a news release from BYU. 
Looks like the BYU rig might last for a while; only time will tell.
Kudos to the folks at BYU!
Despite what you may hear, manual well drilling methods have been used successfully for a number of years. The Terry Waller method  (the so-called 'Baptist method') has been used by the SAIWI  folks at UNR to teach those in developing regions how to drill and construct their own water wells. I know it has been used in Bolivia, Kenya, Ethiopia, and Nicaragua.
Here is a video of the Waller method.
 
Learn more about the Waller approach from his NGO.
"We have been persuaded to spend money we don’t have on things we don’t need to create impressions that won’t last on people we don’t care about.” - Tim Jackson (thanks to Terry Hollister Meyer and Jerry Sehlke)

2011 AWRA Annual Water Resources Conference: Preliminary Program and Barnett, Fishman, and Zetland!



The preliminary program for AWRA's 2011 Annual Water Resources Conference has just been posted!
Here is the program-at-a-glance:  Download ABQ2011-At-A-Glance
Here is information on the poster session and the oral sessions.
Here is the blurb from Conference Chair Stephanie J. Moore:

The Conference Planning Committee has been hard at work on the Preliminary Program. We  had an overwhelming response to our call for abstracts, with over 350 submissions! More than half of all abstracts were submitted to Special Sessions, which were proposed and organized by water-resources professionals spanning a broad spectrum of organizations and interests. We’re excited about the Special Session concept because it allowed our members and conference participants to directly inform the conference planning process by proposing the topics that are most important for discussion right now. Topics addressed by Special Sessions at this year’s conference will include: climate change, remote sensing, instream flows, surface-water quality modeling, groundwater vulnerability, resource interdependencies, green infrastructure, water resources management, water marketing, and many more.
The Conference Planning Committee includes Laura Bexfield (U.S. Geological Survey), Claudia Borchert (City of Santa Fe), Michelle Henrie (Land and Water Law), Kelly Isaacson (Daniel B. Stephens & Associates), Jesse Roach (Sandia National Laboratories), and Mark Stone (University of New Mexico). Thanks to their efforts, we’ve assembled a strong Conference Program, which includes:

High-quality Technical Program, with close to 300 individual oral presentations, nine panel discussions, and a poster session
Presenters representing  41 states, 11 nations, and 5 continents
Keynote address by Cynthia Barnett, author of Blue Revolution: Unmaking America’s Water Crisis
Awards Luncheon keynote address by Charles Fishman, author of The Big Thirst: The Secret Life and Turbulent Future of Water
Pre-Conference (November 6) Field Trip exploring the surface water and groundwater resources of the City of Santa Fe
Two pre-conference workshops: one on the USGS-developed SPARROW Decision Support System and another on Integrated Water Resources Modeling
A Student Career Night that will provide students the opportunity to hear from professionals with a variety of backgrounds
Three book sales and signing events by Cynthia Barnett, author of Blue Revolution: Unmaking America’s Water Crisis; Charles Fishman, author of the Big Thirst: The Secret Life and Turbulent Future of Water; and David Zetland, author of The End of Abundance: Economic Solutions to Water Scarcity.

The Conference will be held at the Hyatt Regency in downtown Albuquerque, conveniently located within walking distance of local restaurants and with easy access to major transportation corridors including the Rail Runner train to Santa Fe and the Rapid Ride bus to the University area. 
Have a look at the Preliminary Program and make your travel plans to join us for the Annual Conference in Albuquerque!

How about that - three authors!
Don't forget that New Mexico has great fall weather!
And remember...
“Until I came to New Mexico, I never realized how much beauty water adds to a river.” – Mark Twain
"Every calculation, based on experience, elsewhere, fails in New Mexico." -- Gen. Lew Wallace, New Mexico Territorial Governor, in a letter to his wife (1878)

Blast from the Past: Luna B. Leopold on 'A Reverence for Rivers'


  Beautiful day here in Key West at the AWRA Florida Section's annual meeting. I feel like I'm a million miles from anywhere.
More on rivers today after yesterday's similar post.
During a discussion on the Middle Rio Grande Water Assembly discussion list  on developing deep saline aquifers in New Mexico, Steve Harris of Rio Grande Restoration sent around this 1977 address by Albuquerque's favorite son, Luna B. Leopold.
Well worth reading.
 Download LLeopold.A Reverence for Rivers
"There are in various parts of the western states ground-water bodies too deep to be economically developed under usual economic standards,   or they have marginal water quality. These, and especially those remnants of the ice-age ground-water bodies not being recharged now,  should be saved from ordinary development and reserved only for times   of exceptional need. But advance engineering is needed to explore and  tap them and to connect to them transmission lines ready for some  future contingency." ---Luna B. Leopold,  "A Reverence for Rivers" (1977)

Op-Ed: A Call to Enhance the Resiliency of the Nation's Water Management


 Here's an editorial by Andrew Warner and Jeffrey J. Opperman of The Nature Conservancy and Robert Pietrowsky of the USACE's Institute for Water Resources and ICIWaRM.
The focus is on river basin management - flood risk management, reconnection of streams with their floodplains, and ecosystem restoration (I tend to use Bill Woessner's term 'renaturalization'). The Green River in Kentucky is offered as an example of what can happen when agencies, stakeholders, and NGOs work together
I can tell times have changed - a high Corps official and two TNC scientists co-authoring an editorial in an engineering journal (J. of Water Resources Planning and Management)? C'mon!
That's good.
Excellent reading!

More on Antimalarials: An Artemisinin Alternative?


After I posted on antimalarial drugs, Dr. Jacqueline (Jacky) Chan, Executive Director of the excellent organization Water Charity, kindly provided some additional information on antimalarials. She discusses Artemisinin, a natural compound that kills the malaria parasite. She graciously sent along two articles that I have posted below her message.

Hi, Michael.
Thought you might be interested in learning about Artemisinin - a natural compound that actually kills the malaria parasite.  What I like about it is that it doesn't have to be used until you know you have malaria, and it fights the organism at every stage of its development, supposedly killing them within 4 to 5 days.  Attached are two articles of the very large literature on artemisinin.  They are just beginning to find some resistance to it in limited areas, and recommend taking it in conjunction with one of the anti-malarials you have discussed already.  Artemisinin can be purchased online from websites selling supplements.  
Hope you find the articles interesting and helpful.  I am planning a trip to India in October, and am going to carry the artemisinin in case I catch the dreaded disease.  I'm sorry that I cannot give you personal experience about how effective it is, this as this will be my first trip to an infested country, but the literature looks pretty convincing.  
Wishing you a safe and healthy trip.

Suppose further that no one doubted that similar children-filled jumbo jets would crash at this level every day into the indefinite future. Don't you think that at some point something big would be done about this slaughter of the innocents?" -- Ralph Nader, on malaria

Antimalarials: Chloroquine Conundrum, Mefloquine Madness, or Doxycycline Delight?


Yesterday I started my 'TGIF' post with a brief blurb on the 'joys' of taking antimalarial drugs, specifically  chloroquine (Aralen) and mefloquine (Lariam). I had just started taking chloroquine in preparation for a trip to rural eastern Honduras.
The post generated some comments via email and Twitter. The most interesting comment was this one from a retired geography professor:

Have you investigated doxycycline for your antimalarial for Honduras? For some reason, use of doxycycline as an antimalarial is not well known in USA, but strongly advised by British and Australian authorities, for example. You have to check for applicability in Honduras. Since there seems to be no chloroquine resistance there, aralen may be sufficient, but doxycycline should be fine, too.
Advantage of doxycycline: you have a background antibiotic, also against tummy upset. And you save the usual malaria drugs if you do get a case that needs it.  Disadvantage: a few people are more photo-sensitive.
 

He then provided a link to a UK publication, Guidelines for malaria prevention in travellers from the United Kingdom 2007.
I'll be sure to check with my health care professional on my next visit.
Your comments are welcomed.

TGIF - Tweets Galore! It's Friday, 22 July 2011 - Special Chloroquine Edition


 Scroll down to where the Tweets start if you don't want to read about chloroquine.
Say what? Chloroquine? If it sounds like a medicine, that's because it is - specifically, an anti-malarial drug.
Odd nominee for a 'special edition' but that's what happens when you take cholorquine - erratic behavior is sometimes produced.  Then again, I could have had a special edition titled 'Debt Limit'.
Since I am heading to Honduras on a few weeks and will be traveling in rural areas during the rainy season (I'm hoping it will hold off for a while) I started taking my 500 mg choloroquine tablets (brand name Aralen - chloroquine phosphate) yesterday: one per week starting two weeks before travel and continuing until four weeks after I arrive home. 
Here is what the Wikipedia entry says under 'History' [emboldening mine]:

Chloroquine (CQ), N'-(7-chloroquinolin-4-yl)-N,N-diethyl-pentane-1,4-diamine, was discovered in 1934 by Hans Andersag and co-workers at the Bayer laboratories who named it "Resochin". It was ignored for a decade because it was considered too toxic for human use. During World War II, United States government-sponsored clinical trials for anti-malarial drug development showed unequivocally that CQ has a significant therapeutic value as an anti-malarial drug. It was introduced into clinical practice in 1947 for the prophylactic treatment of malaria.

The stuff has a lot of side effects, including eye damage. Since I am being treated for retinal problems, specifically mentioned, I called my ophthalmologist to get his blessing.
One of its other side effects is euphemistically called 'vivid dreams', i.e., nightmares. Its stronger cousin, mefloquine, which I've also taken, is especially potent in this regard. The brand name version of mefloquine, Lariam, is no longer marketed in the USA. Probably a good idea.
 Then there is liver damage.
I think the disease is worse than the cure.
By the way - I have finally finished The Big Thirst and will post my review in a week.
 Here is your weekly 'dose' of water displacement behavior!

Boulder Briefs 2: Exempt Wells, Acequias, Culture, and Hydrology


This is the second and likely last of two posts on some of my impressions of the recently concluded UCOWR-NIWR meeting in Boulder, CO, last week. Again, these posts will not constitute an all-inclusive summary by any means. 
You should be able to access speaker bios, conference proceedings and PDFs of Power Points (forthcoming) by visiting the WWW site. 
Today I will focus on the session on exempt domestic wells and water governance.
Exempt Domestic WellsJohn Tracy of the University of Idaho summarized the recent (17-18 May 2011) Exempt Wells Conference  (here is a summary from the NGWA blog;  here are the presentations).
 These wells are becoming a problem in some areas because even though they may not withdraw a lot of water - mosts states restrict withdrawals to around 5000 gallons per day (gpd) although here in Oregon we allow 15,000 gpd. The moniker 'exempt' is a misnomer; the wells are not necessarily exempt from regulation but do not require a certificated water right (except in Utah). The term is generally used to mean domestic wells, stock wells, small industrial wells, etc.
Tracy summarized the isseus:

Impact on senior water rights holders
water quality issues (poor well construction, also the association between exempt wells and septic tanks, lack of water testing)
Well life cycles (proper abandonment, etc.)
Land development and use

 And needs:

Better data on locations
Better education for exempt well users
Better water quality testing sources fro exempt well users

And themes:

Reflect growth pressures
Site-based solutions needed - no 'one size fits all'
Relationship building and leadership are keys

After Tracy, there were presentations by Nathan Bracken, Jesse Richardson, and Todd Jarvis. All three presented at the Walla Walla conference.
Jarvis, with OSU's IWW, summarized some of the issues with exempt wells and land use in Oregon. Richardson, with the Water Systems Council, summarized statutes in the US. He also opined that the exempt well kerfuffle is really about controlling growth. Bracken, with the Western States Water Council, gave an equation:
Growth + Water = Exempt Well Demand
If you have growth and you need water, exempt domestic wells are a solution.
Later, a panel discussion was held with all of the above plus Kevin Rein of the Colorado Division of Water Resources. Very good discussion and Q & A.
I've posted a lot on exempt wells - you can do a search on the left sidebar.Here is an example from WA and the famous Bounds case from NM, plus a guest post by Ray Walker.
********* 
Water Governance  - Acequias, Climate Change, Culture, Water and EcosystemsAt the meeting I was surprised and very pleased to see friend and colleague José A. Rivera of the School of Architecture and Planning at UNM. He was there for a Water Governance session that featured the NSF-funded project that I blogged about earlier this year. Rivera and his colleagues - Brian Hurd and Sam Fernald (the PI) of NMSU, Vince Tidwell of Sandia National Laboratories - and their students gave some wonderful presentations of their plans for the work, which had just been funded. 
Tidwell will be handling the development of a system dynamics model. It will definitely be a quantitative approach.
 Here is an excerpt from a news release from NMSU about the project:

 Water is the life blood of a community. Through the centuries, northern New Mexico communities along traditional acequia irrigation canals have managed the limited water resource provided by nature in ways that modern society can learn and benefit from.New Mexico State University’s College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences has received a $1.4 million grant from the National Science Foundation to provide new insights into the relationships between traditional water management systems, communities and landscapes.“We think there are clues for future water sustainability within these acequia systems,” said NMSU’s Sam Fernald, associate professor of watershed management, who is principal investigator of the five-year study. “We want to quantify how these inter-relationships benefit local communities and downstream water users.”
The study will involve hydrologists, sociologists, economists, anthropologists, remote sensing specialists, and rangeland and ecosystem scientists from NMSU, the University of New Mexico, Sandia Labs, New Mexico Tech University, Maxwell Museum at UNM, the University of Idaho, the University of Nevada at Reno and the University of Concepcion in Chile, as well as the New Mexico Acequia Association and community members from El Rito, Arroyo Hondo and Valdez, Velarde and Alcalde and surrounding areas.Acequias consist of gravity-fed earthen canals that divert stream water flow for distribution in fields. These systems lie at the center of a set of complex self-maintaining interactions between culture and nature that appear to enable drought survival and maintain other socio-cultural and ecosystem benefits.
 

Rivera, an expert on acequias (he penned an wonderful book, Acequia Culture), reminded me that the current project was similar to one we (Rivera, Marilyn O'Leary, and I) submitted to NSF about six years ago. It was not as comprehensive as the current one, and ours was not funded. I am very anxious to see how this fascinating project evolves.
All in all, an excellent meeting, and it was good to see some folks I had not seen in a long time- Dave Kreamer (UNLV); Ron Kaiser and Val Silvy (Texas A & M); Ken Rainwater (Texas Tech); Reagan Waskom and Faith Sternlieb (Colorado State); Gretchen Rupp (Montana State); Joe Delfino (U of FL); Sharon Megdal (U of AZ); Maria Milanes-Murcia (U of the Pacific); Laurel Saito (U of NV); Bob Pietrowsky and Will Logan (USACE-IWR); and Steve Solomon, the author, who gave a great talk. 
Think I will attend the next meeting in Santa Fe in 2012.
