Beyonce entered the world on Sept. 4, 1981. Now it’s 30 years later, and she’s one of the most recognizable faces on the planet — so much so that her onstage baby bump reveal at the MTV Video Music Awards last Sunday shattered Twitter’s tweets-per-second record.

Which “Best Thing I Never Had” Cover Is Your Favorite?

Last Week’s Face-Off Winner

The beatbox cover of Katy Perry’s “Firework” from Peter Hollens snagged 60% of the votes in last week’s face-off. Hollens covered “Firework” because of the song’s inspirational message and uptempo beat. It “really highlights the message that we are all unique and special,” he told Mashable.
Hollens — who appeared on season 2 of NBC’s The Sing-Off and has strong fan bases on Facebook, Google+, Twitter and YouTube — recently released his first music video for an original song called “Sleepwalking” (see video #2 below).
“I just want to be able to make a living making music and inspiring others,” said Hollens, who wants to perform a duet with fellow YouTube cover artist/producer Kurt Schneider as well as celebrities Adele and Sara Bareilles. “I also hope to bring a cappella music to the forefront of popular music today … and to teach everyone how to actually spell a cappella.”

Wacom Inkling Redefines Digital Drawing [VIDEO]


Posted: Wed, 31 Aug 2011 21:17:48 +0000



Each day, Mashable highlights one noteworthy YouTube video. Check out all our viral video picks.

Japanese company Wacom is famous for its pen tablets that let users easily create precision drawings and artwork on a Mac or PC. Now the company is introducing a new product, Inkling, that claims to make it easy to seamlessly transfer drawings on regular paper into layered, digital vector files that can be edited in Sketchbook Pro, Illustrator or Photoshop.
Checking out the video: It looks like what Inkling does is capture the coordinates of the specially designed pen so that those movements can be transferred as a digital source. 
Inkling will be out in mid-September 2011 and retail for $199.99. We’ve already reached out for a review unit and hope to put the product through its paces soon.

Adventure World: Zynga Unveils Newest Social Game [VIDEO]


Posted: Wed, 31 Aug 2011 03:22:50 +0000


Zynga has released the first trailer for Adventure World, the company’s newest social game.
The 37-second trailer shows off a slew of new maps, complete with ancient temples, volcanoes, whips, snakes and death traps. The game’s look and feel reminds us of Indiana Jones, but with the same animation style that has made FarmVille and CityVille big hits. “Grab life by the boulders!” seems to be the game’s overarching slogan.
There’s no word as to when the game will launch, but we suspect it will be sooner rather than later. The company has ben ramping up its game development as of late. It most recently launched Pioneer Trail as an extension of FrontierVille. Its other games include Words With Friends, Empires & Allies, Cafe World, Mafia Wars and Zynga Poker.
Check out the trailer above and let us know what you think of Adventure World in the comments.

Each day, Mashable highlights one noteworthy YouTube video. Check out all our viral video picks.


Fashion’s having a little fun of the dancing variety lately, as Lanvin’s fall campaign video (above) suggests.
The video, which was shot by Steven Meisel and features a handful of models including Racquel Zimmerman and Karen Elson dancing to Pitbull’s I Know You Want Me, has racked up more than 100,000 views since it debuted Saturday. A print campaign featuring stills from the video is currently running in fashion-focused women’s titles, including U.S. Vogue‘s September issue.
Be sure to watch out for artistic director Alber Elbaz’s cameo at the end.

Hyundai Cheats Death in “Banned” Dutch Ad [VIDEO]


Posted: Tue, 30 Aug 2011 02:08:05 +0000



Each day, Mashable highlights one noteworthy YouTube video. Check out all our viral video picks.


As viewers of The Seventh Seal know, you can’t really foil Death; you can just hold him off for a while.
One way to do that, according to this Dutch ad, is to drive a Hyundai Velostar. Or, more accurately, to be a backseat passenger. That’s because the model has three doors instead of four and the back row door opens on the passenger’s side. So, there may be cases, like the one dramatized here, where that makes the difference between life and death. 
Ad agency Fitzroy makes the point well. Maybe too well. The ad was supposedly banned most likely for being too graphic. But Amsterdam Ad Blog floats the plausible theory that Hyundai got it banned on purpose. That, or it was never banned in the first place. 
Makes sense, especially when you consider that this Volkswagen ad actually ran in the much more squeamish U.S.

Twitter Boasts That It’s Faster Than Earthquakes [VIDEO]


Posted: Sat, 27 Aug 2011 01:16:54 +0000


Twitter has released a short promotional video that touts that it’s faster than an earthquake.
The 47-second short notes draws attention to the fact that Twitter messages hit New York City before Virginia’s 5.9 magnitude earthquake had a chance to reach the Big Apple. The man in the video, warned of the quake via Twitter, picks up his mug before the quake strikes. He easily ignores the Twitter pillows and napkins being thrown at him.
The quake, which caused minimal damage, has been the subject of countless social media jokes. We expect that some will find the video insensitive, while others will laugh at the video’s whimsical nature.
At the very least, we agree with the video: Twitter is faster than earthquakes. Check out the video above and let us know what you think of the social media service’s video in the comments.

Interact with Lil Wayne’s New Video with Your iPhone [VIDEO]


Posted: Fri, 26 Aug 2011 23:58:20 +0000



Each day, Mashable highlights one noteworthy YouTube video. Check out all our viral video picks.


Music app Shazam has teamed up with Vevo to create a special Shazam for TV-enhanced version of Lil Wayne’s new video, How to Love.
Shazam recently raised $32 million to expand its efforts in creating interactive ads for television content. Weezy’s new video, How to Love, is the first music video that will incorporate Shazam for TV.
Users can use the Shazam app while watching the video on YouTube or Vevo to get access to Weezy’s discography, buy a digital copy of the single and enter a contest to see Lil Wayne in concert. Plus, users can also watch the video on their iPhone or Android devices after they open the tag.


Music videos are an interesting place for Shazam for TV to set its sights. It’s also unique, in this case, that the Shazam experience can be activated through Vevo, where presumably users are watching content online.
We’re fans of the technique and we also dig the video. Let us know your thoughts in the comments.

PostSecret App Lets You Reveal Your Hidden Thoughts [VIDEO]


Posted: Thu, 25 Aug 2011 20:21:15 +0000



Each day, Mashable highlights one noteworthy YouTube video. Check out all our viral video picks.


The concept behind the deliciously dishy PostSecret books and blog will soon make its way to your mobile device. 
Since 2004, PostSecret has received more than 300,000 secrets via postcards from anonymous contributors. But now, the forthcoming PostSecret App, which the above video touts, will allow contributors to digitally share secrets, discover other users’ hush-hush thoughts and react to their submissions. 
“For the first time, like-minded secret sharers will easily be able to make a connection, show their support or reach out to someone whose secret touches them, makes them wonder, laugh or cry,” PostSecret said.
PostSecret has built a hefty following, one that will likely help this app succeed: more than 1 million Facebook fans, 420,000 Twitter followers, 500,000 email subscribers and 4.1 million unique visitors to the PostSecret blog in July.
iPhone users can get their hands on the app in September for $1.99, and Android folks will have access to the app sometime after that. 
What do you think of the secrets shared in the video? Will you use this app?

Andrew W.K., Soulja Boy Sing in Converse-Hosted Zombie Bash [VIDEO]


Posted: Thu, 25 Aug 2011 03:27:36 +0000



Each day, Mashable highlights one noteworthy YouTube video. Check out all our viral video picks.


Here’s a very 2011 approach to advertising: Sneaker brand Converse created a studio called Rubber Tracks where bands can record their music. Converse isn’t a music publisher, though, just a sort of patron to the arts.
The latest fruit of this arrangement is this video featuring Matt & Kim, Andrew W.K. and Soulja Boy singing “I’m a Goner,” a jaunty tune about death. The video doesn’t shy away from the subject matter, with a Night Shift-like party in a morgue replete with dancing zombies.
The message: Next time you want to dance on someone’s grave, suit up with some Converse kicks.

The band OK Go has released a new video for its version of the theme song for The Muppet Show. The video features the band alongside Kermit the Frog, Rolf the Dog and more.
The song is from the new Muppet tribute album, The Green Album [iTunes link], in stores today. The album contains covers of various songs from The Muppets, covered by  OK Go, Andrew Bird, My Morning Jacket and other artists.
The Muppets are in the midst of a cultural rebirth. In November, Disney is bringing The Muppets to theaters. The film stars Amy Adams, Jason Segel and of course the Muppets themselves. It’s one of my most-anticipated films of the year.

Think New Yorkers are rude? Think again. The people at Improv Everywhere decided to put a megaphone on a lectern in public places across New York City, encouraging passersby to “Say Something Nice.”
The project was a collaboration between Improv Everywhere and the Guggenheim Museum exhibition “stillspotting nyc.”
It’s nice to know that when given the opportunity, people can spread positive messages to those around them — even in the city that never sleeps.

10 Brilliant Interactive Billboards [VIDEOS]


Posted: Sun, 21 Aug 2011 23:02:37 +0000
Advertising billboards are just part of the background of modern, urban living. The challenge for marketers is to get us to notice something we are used to passing by without a second glance. 
One way to achieve this is by making a billboard interactive, giving consumers a good reason to stop and engage with the medium, rather than just walk on past.
We’ve found 10 excellent examples of interactive advertising. Take a look through the video gallery and let us know in the comments which ones you find the most engaging. 

1. Big in Japan Interactive Billboard







A promotion for a reality TV show gives passers-by a taste of fame. 
2. JCDecaux Innovate for Cadbury







What better way to kill time at the bus stop than splatting some chocolate eggs? 
3. Honda Interactive Billboard







As well as the ability to "start" the car by texting to an SMS shortcode, this Honda ad also offered more info via Bluetooth. 
4. McDonald's Interactive Billboard







By making its billboard a game and giving consumers free food, McDonald's guarantees engagement. 
5. JCDecaux Innovate for Yell







This outdoor touchscreen ad offers consumers useful local info. 
6. Live Interactive Billboard 







This high-impact concept confronts the public with their inactivity in the face of a green-screened scene of aggression toward public service workers. 
7. Xerox - Airport Interactive Billboard







Airport travellers are a captive audience. Xerox made the most of this fact with an enticing touchscreen tease. 
8. JCDecaux Innovate for Skunk Anansie







Passers-by were encouraged to do their best Skunk Anansie impression in this clever campaign. While the loudest could enter a draw to win free tickets, everyone who had a go got sent their performance as a video clip to their mobile phones.  
9. IBM Ad Changes Color To Match Your Outfit







If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery then this IBM billboard, which changed color to match your clothes, was a clever stunt. 
10. Google Video Outdoor Campaign







Google gives tourists a great photo opportunity with this outdoor campaign.

Our Favorite YouTube Videos This Week: The Music Video Edition Vol. II


Posted: Sat, 20 Aug 2011 00:03:42 +0000



Happy Friday, denizens of the web! We know we’ve had a Music Video roundup before, but now is as good time as any to face the music — again!
Plug in, turn it up and jam out. This will be the last YouTube Roundup of this kind (Mashable copy editor Brian Hernandez will be taking over next week) as today is my very last day at Mashable. Happy weekend all, and see you on the other side!

Pearl Jam, "Jeremy"







Josh Catone: When I think "music video," this is what pops into my head.  (Sometimes it's "Smells Like Teen Spirit" that I think of, but I'm never 100% sure if I am remembering the Nirvana version, or Weird Al's...) 
Pavement, "Cut your hair"







Todd Wasserman: Proof that Pavement should have made a movie. 
Blind Melon, "No Rain"







Jay Bischof: Who’s going to be the first to break the '90s rock theme? Not me. 
Dan Black, "Symphonies ft. Kid Cudi"







Brian Hernandez: This was my favorite video of 2010. Why? So much TYPOGRAPHY! 
Art Of Noise, "Moments In Love"







Jennifer Diamond: Taking it back to the 80s with Art of Noise. 
Rick Astley, "Never Gonna Give You Up"







Stephanie Haberman: To the Mashable community, with love. 
Busta Rhymes, "Woo Hah!! (Got You All in Check)"







Todd Olmstead: Hype Williams and Busta Rhymes were an epic combination.  
Aerosmith, "Crazy"







Stacy Green: Aerosmith, "Crazy." No further comment. 
Lykke Li, "I Follow Rivers"







Stephanie Buck: There's always room for an uncomfortably haunting video from Lykke Li. 
"Total Eclipse of the Heart: Literal Video Version"







Meghan Peters: Also taking it back to the '80s -- literally. 
Fiona Apple, "Criminal"







Christina Warren: Mark Romanek is probably my favorite music video director of all time, and although I think "Hurt" by Johnny Cash is probably his best work,  I decided to take it back a bit to one of my other favorite videos, "Criminal" by Fiona Apple. Even without the context of the Calvin Klein campaign (which influenced the editorial style of this video), the video/song still hold up 14 years later.  
Missy Elliott, "The Rain"







Chelsea Stark: Piggybacking on the '90s... I always loved this video.. 
Avril Lavigne, "Complicated"







Zachary Sniderman: Once dead-panned this chorus to a high-school history teacher. No joke. 
Twisted Sister, "We're Not Gonna Take It"







Robyn Peterson: The worst and best (simultaneously) music video ever made.  Embarrassing confession: I just taught my three-year-old girls to sing this song.  
Broken Bells, "The Ghost Inside"







Chris Taylor: Broken Bells. Asteroids. Christina Hendricks. Need I say more? 
Korn, "Freak On A Leash"







Ada Ospina: "Take On Me" (A-ha) was backup option.  
NewVillager, "LightHouse"







Brenna Ehrlich: Rad song. Weird as hell video. NSFW: Theatrical sex.

Tom Waits is said to be releasing his first new material in seven years next week (with any luck, he’ll unveil Wristcutters II). If you find you can’t wait until then, however, one YouTube user has created this epic lip dub of “God’s Away on Business” featuring the Cookie Monster.
Whether or not you think Tom Waits would be this stoked about baked goods, you have to admit, the vocal resemblance is eerie.

Anne Hathaway Attacks “Dark Knight” Paparazzi with Rap [VIDEO]


Posted: Wed, 17 Aug 2011 21:02:15 +0000


While promoting her latest film, One Day, actress Anne Hathaway showed off one of her hidden talents to Conan O’Brien: rapping.
Inspired by photographers’ obsession with The Dark Knight Rises, currently in production, Hathaway performed a rap called “Paparazzi” in what she called “the style of Lil’ Wayne.”
Perhaps the most surprising part: Hathaway isn’t a bad rapper.
Christopher Nolan’s third (and presumably final) Batman film stars Hathaway as Catwoman, and is slated to hit theaters next summer. In May, fans went to great lengths to crack the first viral campaign behind the film’s website and the first teaser trailer for the film was a massive success.
As the film finishes up shooting scenes in Pittsburgh, photos from the set have been finding their way onto the web at a frenetic pace. Earlier this month, the first production still of Hathaway dressed as Catwoman hit the web. This photo was immediately analyzed by movie fan sites and blogs.
What do you think of Hathaway’s rapping ability and the Dark Knight hype? Let us know in the comments.

5 Years of YouTube Politics [INFOGRAPHIC]


Posted: Mon, 15 Aug 2011 17:38:00 +0000
YouTube, which has quickly become the media site of record, has put together an infographic celebrating five years of political highs and lows. 
If someone important does anything wonderful, stupid or wonderfully stupid on camera — it is likely the site has the video. This is typically true of the political arena, as politicians often make gaffes while they’re on the road, whether it’s during bill debates or a casual conversation.
YouTube and other video hosting sites provide a place where the public can find and watch hours of clips featuring elected officials. More than 500 U.S. candidates for office have official channels.
Of course, it’s not all fail videos and mistakes, YouTube has also played an increasingly large role in elections and the day-to-day operations of the White House. So now the site has gone back and traced its complicated but important relationship with American politics starting with then-Sen. George Allen’s (R.-Va.) racial slur — “macaca” — as the video that put YouTube on the political map.
Take a look at how YouTube and politics have grown, from President Barack Obama’s weekly addresses, CNN’s debates in 2007 to the 2012 presidential announcement videos. Is YouTube and government a match made in heaven? Does video, especially on a free and open site like  YouTube, help the political process? Let us know your thoughts in the comments.

This Is Exactly What the Music Business Is Like [VIDEO]


Posted: Mon, 15 Aug 2011 15:17:12 +0000


As any musician can tell you, it’s hard to catch a break in the biz. Montreal Band the Barr Brothers faced considerable grief when trying to get their debut disc released, a process they very accurately depict in the above video.
And by accurately, we mean not so much. The vid imagines the journey from unsigned to signed as a gunslinging adventure in the Old West that ends with the band‘s untimely demise. In real life, however, they were signed to Secret City, and their disc drops on September 27.
Check out a free track from the band, “Beggar in the Morning,” here.

Seeing that it’s Friday, it’s likely that your mental capacity has degraded to the point at which only one lucid thought can dwell in your mind. We’re guessing that word is “cats.”
Yup, we’ve already had two YouTube Roundups centered around felines, but can you ever really get enough of those furry little fiends? We think not. And if you beg to differ, you might want to check on the status of your soul.

Posted: Thu, 11 Aug 2011 17:22:49 +0000



Each day, Mashable highlights one noteworthy YouTube video. Check out all our viral video picks.


Remember that iPad Head Girl video we posted the other week? Well, the folks behind the head have posted a video explaining just what went into creating the cranium, a clever ad campaign for Cosmo‘s iPad-only magazine for men.
Cosmopolitan — of sex tips and dating quips fame — launched its first magazine for men, Cosmo For Guys the other week. The magazine will not be gracing newsstands but will live solely on the iPad, available via the App Store [iTunes link] for $1.99 per issue, $3.99 per month or $19.99 per year.
To herald the coming of the mag, Cosmo teamed up with Michael Krivicka’s viral video marketing agency, Thinkmodo (the folks behind such fake viral hits as “Frank’s Marriage Proposal in Central Park”) to create “iPad Head Girl.”
Check out the video above to see how it all went down.

Really into Google+? Well, now you have a new tune to jam to whilst jamming people into circles.
This little video comes from Break Media and extols the joy of the newly minted network — in a tongue-in-cheek way, to the tune of Queen’s “Another One Bites The Dust.”
What do you think? Are you in love with Google+?
Scroll down for more Google+ fodder.

1. The Google Minus Project







This is genius. No spoilers, but if you watch one parody video on Google+, we urge you to make it this one. 
2. Dmitri Finds Out About Google Plus







Dmitri's journey of discovery continues as he's informed of the launch of the new tool and what it means for online privacy. His joy is, of course, evident. 
3. Google- Anti-Social Network Preview







Did you think you were all cutting-edge with your Google+ invite? Well, Google Minus is the new Plus.

It just had to be done (and it has been several times, but this version is our favorite) if only for the line spoken before the majority of the group leaves the room.

Make Your Videos Interactive With Viewbix


Posted: Wed, 10 Aug 2011 16:13:36 +0000



Videos are standard viral fare of the web — they’re passed around so much that often people have no idea where they came from. A startup called Viewbix seeks to rectify that issue, with a service that lets anyone make a video interactive.
Viewbix is basically a nicer version of YouTube annotations: Visit the site (which is free), add a video from YouTube or Facebook and start customizing. Add a title, a link to your website, details about the video, photos and a variety of apps (Google Maps, an RSS feed, Twitter feeds, Skype, a QR Code) and share your video. It will now be wrapped in all of your info so that when it’s passed along, users will know who you are and where to find you. Check out my test below.
We can see this service being a huge boon to bands — especially when promoting a show. Imagine releasing a promotional music video complete with show info, location (Google Maps), ticketing info (Skype) and a QR Code featuring some kind of at-show promotion.
Viewbix plans to release its premium product soon. The first 1,000 Mashable readers who sign up and create a player will get six months of premium service for free (when it’s released).

Without further ado, here’s the theme of this week’s YouTube roundup: beer.
Remember all: Mashable is an international publication, so that means it’s 5 o’clock for at least some of our readers. We promise.

The 10 Most-Shared Beer Ads of All Time [VIDEOS]


Posted: Fri, 05 Aug 2011 19:54:54 +0000
Beer ads have a reputation for hitting the lowest common denominator. Just get a few babes in bikinis, throw in a fart joke or two and you’re done, right?
Actually, this list of the most-shared beer ads of all time, as measured by Unruly Media, is bereft of both elements. True, a few of the ads don’t have much to say beyond “men are pigs,” but one or two could be called poignant.
Others, however, might better be called “weird,” including a deadpan paean to Pabst Blue Ribbon by a guy named Tom Raper, and what looks like a brewery run by Willy Wonka.

So, on International Beer Day, sit back with your favorite brew and check out these top ads. 

1. "9/11" (Budweiser)







Bud's ad acknowledging the 9/11 attacks ran only once -- during the 2002 Super Bowl. The ad shows the brand's Clydesdales seeming to bow before the New York skyline. 
2. "Walk-In Fridge" (Heineken)







While women get excited about big walk-in closets, men are tickled by a walk-in fridge with lots of Heinekens. And no, you're not going mad. The people in this ad are speaking Dutch.  
3. "Men With Talent" (Heineken)







A variation on "Walk-in Fridge" shows men getting excited about a TV talent competition. Why? Because the contestants are doing their stunts with Heinekens. 
4. "Hipotesis" Quilmes 







A bunch of friends decide that it's important to spend time together in this ad for Argentine brand Quilmes. Shout out to Alain Espinosa for the translation.  
5. "The Asteroids Galaxy Tour" a.k.a. "The Entrance" (Heineken)








A James Bond type enters a bar where a retro-looking singer is crooning an annoyingly catchy song in this rather over-the-top ad from Wieden + Kennedy in Amsterdam.  
6. "Swear Jar" (Budweiser)







A big hit from Budweiser's failed Bud.tv venture, "Swear Jar" never aired on TV, probably because it was too edgy.  
7. "Pabst Blue Ribbon Commercial" (Pabst Blue Ribbon)







The hipster's favorite beer gets a deadpan ad by a man named Tom Raper who is proud of his country and disappointed in Anheuser-Busch, which was bought out by "some Arabs who probably don't even have a country." He also ushers in what may be the best beer tagline ever: "Drink it, you assholes." 
8. "Wassup" (Budweiser)







"Wassup" had the misfortune of hitting in 1999 -- way before YouTube. Still, it was pretty viral in its day, when people used to repeat lines they heard in ads rather than just send links.  
9. "Most Epic Beer Commercial Ever" (Hahn Super Dry) 







Imagine the coolest brewery ever, with an in-house drummer whose set is used to filter the beer and a giant Elvis suit. Now add the Knight Rider theme. 
10. "Clydesdales Donkey" (Budweiser)







A plucky donkey becomes an honorary Clydesdale in this Bud spot saluting the, uh, underdonkey.

Beluga Whale Dances to Sweet Strains of Mariachi Band [VIDEO]


Posted: Wed, 03 Aug 2011 20:47:11 +0000



Each day, Mashable highlights one noteworthy YouTube video. Check out all our viral video picks.


“Baby Beluga” was so 30 years ago. The new hot jam among the denizens “under the sea” is Mariachi music, as evidenced by this video of a seemingly enchanted whale swaying to the beat.
The vid was shot at the Mystic Aquarium — in my hometown of Mystic, Connecticut — during a wedding. The band apparently took a break from dancing the lovebirds away on a cloud to mingle with marine life.
We humbly applaud the Beluga’s brave decision to dance alone at a wedding. That takes some serious fins.

iPad Head Girl Shills For Cosmo for Guys [VIDEO]


Posted: Tue, 02 Aug 2011 15:10:05 +0000



Each day, Mashable highlights one noteworthy YouTube video. Check out all our viral video picks.


You know that old expression: “I can read you like a book”? Well, a new viral video promoting Cosmo‘s new iPad-only magazine for men pretty much epitomizes it — with a techie twist.
Monday, Cosmopolitan — of sex tips and dating quips fame — launched its first magazine for men, CFG: Cosmo for Guys. The magazine will not be gracing newsstands but will live solely on the iPad, available via the App Store [iTunes link] for $1.99 per issue, $3.99 per month or $19.99 per year.
To herald the coming of the mag, Cosmo teamed up with Michael Krivicka’s viral video marketing agency, Thinkmodo (the folks behind such fake viral hits as “Frank’s Marriage Proposal in Central Park”) to create “iPad Head Girl.”
According to Krivicka, the crew met up with design company Clockwork Apple (the same folks behind Thinkmodo’s “Shaving Helmet” video) to create the iPad head, which features pre-shot footage of the girl walking in the park. The actress was able to see via a hidden camera in her purse and a pair of video glasses inside the helmet. It was more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit that day, so you can imagine how fun that was for the actress.
Thinkmodo has sent us some shots of the “making of” the the above video. Take a look a let us know: What do you think of this kind of viral marketing?

Filming


"The glide-cam operator had to
mount a custom rig that would hold an iPad 2 so he was able to shoot
all four parts of the girl's head smoothly," says Krivicka. "Once we locked those, we assembled the iPad Head and with marked sync points played back all four
video screens while the girl would walk down a specific path." 
Glasses


These glasses helped the actress see inside the head. 
The Head


Sans body.
