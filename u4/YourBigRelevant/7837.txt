2011-08-25: 
					 British men may trace their lineage back to hunter-gatherers, not farmers as had previously been suspected. A new genetic lineage study finds that, contrary to previous research, British men do not descend from immigrant farmers who migrated west from the Near East around 10,000 years ago. Instead, the new study finds that a common Y-chromosome gene in today's British men traces back to hunter-gatherers who settled in Europe long before . In a study first published online in August 2010 in the European Journal of Human Genetics, researchers from the Sorenson Molecular Genealogy Foundation in Utah reported that a...

In 1941 Edward R Dewey together with a group of eminent scientists, businessmen and people in government began the Foundation for the Study of Cycles. The idea was to research cycles, or repeating phenomena, in every branch of human study, scientific, economic and social. He took advice from famous physicist Richard Feynman on the correct interpretation of the surprising results of this research. It has important implications for all branches of human study and if ignored is as big a mistake as doctors ignoring the study of germs. The Foundation for the Study of Cycles foundationforthestudyofcycles.org Cycles Research Institute www.cyclesresearchinstitute.org There is an interdisciplinary cycles discussion forum open to all people to search and read, and people can join to participate, at tech.groups.yahoo.com

www.SERoundtable.com - In this week's recap, I kind of give it to Yahoo. They say I am "irresponsible" for saying they are not a search company when their own CEO said that?! Google's brand search change is out of hand and then they do steaming search results, that's whack! Google gave real time search a home page and additional features, including inclusion in Google Alerts. Google Maps updated their map review guidelines. Google News made a design change, keeps reverting back to old design. A study shows how important those meta descriptions are in your click through rates. Google & SEOs have one of the best duplicate content and pagination discussions ever. Google gives some deep insights into what makes content unique. GoogleBot was caught crawling from three different IPs. Is Google's international filter not so national? Finally, there are three known AdWords bugs advertisers should be aware of. That was this week at the Search Engine Roundtable!

www.SERoundtable.com - This week I do a home produced version of the search engine video recap. I start by documenting a new Google PageRank update and then move on into when is Panda/Farmer hitting Google UK? Google Translate usage can be seen as spam, as I discussed in August of last year. Facebook like buttons won't hurt your rankings. Yahoo released Search Direct, a new approach at instant results. Bing updated their mobile search interface. Bing has a research paper on page credibility, it is very interesting. I covered how to get into Bing News. Google AdWords added additional location targeting and exclusion capabilities. adCenter had major issues yesterday. Google AdWords study guides went offline over the weekend. Google added AdSense added more earnings reports to the new interface overview page. AdSense is changing the "i" icon to an "AdChoices" icon to be in compliance. NYC is likely blocking Google Images in the classrooms. Finally, Google had a special logo for Harry Houdini yesterday. That was this past week at the Search Engine Roundtable.

www.SERoundtable.com - In this weeks recap, we go a bit all over the place to get through the most important topics we covered in the past 7 days. We talked about a study that showed the minor impact Google personalized search has on SEO. There may have been a Yahoo Search update this week. Microsoft says they will purge their search data within 6 months. Bing's auto-search suggestions get more current. Bing also shows search results for related queries. Google increased the Sitemaps limit. Google AdWords now has four professional exams. Yahoo released the network distribution feature, finally. SEOmoz built Open Site Explorer, a neat new useful tool. Google Maps lets you add real time content to your business listing. Don't use the same phone number as your competitor, if you don't want issues on your Google local listing. Search for Jesus on Google Images and you'll catch him smoking and drinking. Google continues to cash in, they announced awesome 4th quarter earnings. SEO is being trademarked again, but the story is different. Martin Luther King day was this week, we have the logos for you. That was this past week at the Search Engine Roundtable.

Notes by host J. Keith van Straaten *On the streets, we talked to dozens of people from all over the world. I don't think we found a single person who said organic food wasn't a better way to go. *The very crafty Jules Dervaes runs the Path To Freedom Urban Homestead with his family. They've created a genuine farm on their plain ol' city lot in Pasadena. They were gracious hosts to us for our shoot. And they didn't give us a hard time for misspelling their family name in the video. *Christine Bybee is indeed a certified nutritionist --and a nutritionist to the stars! The Rutgers University study she cites is actually still a topic of debate in the nutrition community. Judge for yourself. *Anna Getty has already judged and is definitely pro-organic! She's a spokesperson for The Organic Center and understandably I felt a little uncomfortable taking a Big Bite of hot dog in front of her. No worries; I more than made up for it a few weeks later. *The lady serving me my pizza and salad is Mani, our fabulous PA. I call her Libbie as a way of saying hi to my grandmother. What got cut... The salad Mani/Libbie put down was put together by the Dervaes family. It was made entirely from their farm, was 100% organic, and was topped by edible flowers. Yum! Still, the original ending had me getting into a tug-of-war over the non-organic pizza with our cameraman! (He won.)

The planet Mars currently appears rather dull and uninteresting in the night sky, yet it is also drawing nearer to us with each passing day. As we noted last month, 2011 is an "off year" for the fabled Red Planet, since it does not come to opposition â that point in the sky placing it opposite to the sun.
