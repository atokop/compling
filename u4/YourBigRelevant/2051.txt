What is all this hate for us in America ? I mean the people here doesn’t have control over what country our government decides to go after.. Nato and the UN decides that not us.. There are a lot of good people in America some of them may be misguided at times but still lots of good people.

@grownman455 I thinks thats the problem, Americans should be on Capital Hill with there ropes hanging these congressmen. The majority of Congress is out for themselves or the Corporations that control them. I will reach a boiling point one day by then it may be to late for the world. Welcome to the 4th Reich lead by the TBTF Banks and their puppet Obama.

@honestlyimbatman I would personally like to ram your fucking head through a glass fucking window and then grab a large piece of glass and ram it through you fucking skull, however I still have my sense of humor and I’m starting think maybe this was you who went through the fucking window ….and that’s why you have your pussy knickers in a knot  again and again.

@honestlyimbatman Irregular areas? During the last ice age the eastern part of America was covered in 2 miles of ice. This caused the continental plate to shift downwards into the mantle. The pressure within the earth is causing the landmass in the area to rebound upwards. This is well understood and is what caused the 1811 quake. It has nothing to do with gay people. You can nuke the entire planet and make the human species go extinct and this will still happen. It’s physics.

Yes there are millions of good Americans. I love meeting Americans. But collectively Americans come up with a foreign policy that remains hateful, no matter which party is in power.

@gemstone3000 I hope this Ron Paul thing is more than just hype and he can really turn this thing around and give the America people time to find more politicians like him.. So the real Americans can have their guys run against the Banker’s guys and run them as independents..  I might not agree with those tea party people but they caused enough problems to slow down certain laws.. Which something like that could be used to work in the American peoples favor.

@davidsegun Every intelligent Christian who believes in Michele Bachmann’s policies knows that natural disasters don’t occur naturally. They’re due to things like HAARP, homosexuals and liberal ideology.

It’s typical of unAmerican atheist Commies to try to make excuses for the Lord’s work. They are, however, without excuse.

You dumbass fucktards can blame homosexual human beings for the earthquake in Washington, HAARP and whatever nonsense you want, yet the fact still remains that it was caused by the fact that glaciation depressed this area of the planet and it’s rebounding now due to internal pressures within the earth. You can nuke the planet and make humans extinct so there are no more queers, yet this process will still happen….you FUCKING dumbasses.
