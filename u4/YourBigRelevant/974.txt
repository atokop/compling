In case you are just catching the news a 5.9 magnitude earthquake outside of Washington D.C. and up along the east coast is affecting T-Mobile service. The above tweet shows that T-Mobile is aware of the difficulty as are all major operators experiencing trouble and customers are advised to use SMS or e-mail in the meantime. Hope everyone is safe!

I could not make or receive a call in Philly, but my fiends with Verizon were able to text, call and surf the web. If my phone does not work in an emergency, what good is it. Contemplating a switch now.

I am right in the DC area……right after the quake, my internet and email were working fine…..but not able to call out or receive calls in.  It is very frustrating that I could get on FaceBook and use email to communicate with people….but still 2 hours after the quake I cannot make or receive ANY calls.  THE MAIN PURPOSE FOR HAVING A CELL PHONE IN AN EMERGENCY.  Hopefully when T-Mobile integrates with AT&T the service will be better!!!!!!!!

I’m in Philly with t-mobile and nothing’s working… I was able to connect a call a few times but it drops out after 30-60 seconds. Most times it won’t even connect. SMS barely works. Internet works though…

All of u people that live over there were the earthquake hit today are puzzyz lolz.  5.8 is nothing to us Californians.  I live in Los Angeles were there’s an earthquake like every month. Last years we had much stronger earthquakes than 5.8 all in the 6 range and u didn’t hear us people bytching just look up the orange county earthquakes the first one was 6.4 then we had 20 more smaller earthquakes that same day yes 20 more aftershocks! Look it up it happened last year in orange county California my sister lives there she said she wasn’t scared after a while they just got annoying cuz it wud start shaking every 20 minutes, ,  U guys make a big deal out of it its on every dam channel I’m trying to watch my show and I can’t cuz the news are on saying about the earthquake.  Just now they interviewed sum chick that lives in NY she was crying saying da shaking was horrible cmon cry me a river shyytface if she felt one of these California earthquakes on the 6-7 range she wud probably die.. so yea I’m outz

No phone service yet in DC. Text doesn’t work either, just internet.  Disappointing.

@Jennylol22, I’ve been out there in wacky land for some 7.x quakes… The only surprise was that it was on the east coast… I knew exactly what it was. Oh, BTW, we have a possible hurricane on the way! Better warm up the smoke signal fire ’cause I can’t rely on Tmo…

@ jenny lolz I know what u mean over here in LA There’s ALOT of earthquakes I’m used to them. And yes i Remember the orange county earthquake last year my boyfriend lives over there he has Verizon he told me when the 6.4 earthquake hit all cellphone companies crapped out t-mobile, at&t, sprint even Verizon because all his friends have those companies and told me even tho there phones showed full bars of service they couldn’t make calls or send txts at all. Imagine if we had a stronger one in the 8-9 category?  We would be toast lol cuz if they all crapped out in. 6.4 earthquake even Verizon crapped out imagine a stronger one ? I don’t even wanna imagine what would happen… but yea only thing I don’t agree wit u is that ur making phone of the people in NY I actually feel bad for them cuz there not used to earthquakes..

It wasn’t outside of the capital, more like 83 miles away. It happened around mineral, Virginia. I live in Virginia beach, Virginia,I felt it. Why does everyone(news corps) focus on the major cities, not where it happened?

Any updates on reports on cnbc and Wall Street Journal about the next iPhone coming to Sprint, AT&T and Verizon? I was hoping to see T-mobile included in it, but there was no mention about T-mobile. 






Rafinn



I REALLY DON’T WANT TO SLAM TMOBILE- BUT, I couldn’t get a signal with Tmobile but my other work phone that V-company I was able to call others that had At&T and Sprint with no-problem.  That bothers me a little bit. especially since my contracts up and was thinking about switching.  But I’ll give them the benefit of doubt and hopefully they can TRUTHFULLY EXPLAIN WHY they where the only carrier down in my area at the time… and please NO-FLUFF just an honest answer. Thank You

I agree wholeheartedly.  I am the ONLY person in my office who has been unable to get cell phone service … and it has been over 3 hours.  My daughter is out of town, and she has no way of getting in touch with me, because my phone is not working.  Completely and totally unacceptable. I’m with you on the switch to AT&T.

This DC earthquake has convinced me to switch to Verizon.  Co-workers and my girlfriend (both with Verizon) were able to get texts and calls through.  I have Tmo and I couldn’t nearly as fast, and it is still intermittent.  Within the next 2 months Verizon is getting 2 – 3 new LTE smartphones.  Hopefully all workers in DC change to Verizon so we could all communicate for any emergency

Folks, I am not excusing TMo and any lack of service you have experienced but if you spend 30secs on Twiiter, you will notice that every carrier is experiencing issues. People are complaining about these very same issues.

We had a smaller earthquake in So Cal a few years ago and the lines were busy. That’s Californians who are familiar with quakes versus these east coast people who don’t have a clue about em. Oh BTW, I think maybe the rapture is coming! lol

Emergency situations such as this reveal a key weakness in our cell phone infrastructure – insufficient redundancy and inadequate capacity for anything departed too drastically from what might be termed “normal” call volume. Read a story about this very topic not too many years ago, and sure enough, they were right….

You know every carrier was or is having the same problem but its not in the same spot u just happened to be in a place where tmobile was down and verizon was up because I read that verizon was down too.

Wasn’t working in true Center City for half an hour.  And then not working from 17th and Market all the way along West Chester Pike to West Chester.  No service. Just searching.  Went on for 3 hours.






GladIhavethedayoff



Silly east coast people, a 6.0 isn’t scary. Lived in California for the first 22 years of my life. I experienced Loma Prieta back in ’89 (I do remember the quake. I was watching the world series with my Mom, cheering on the Giants. She grabbed me and we were in the bathroom as things were falling over in the kitchen/living room/etc. I lived in Milpitas at the time.)
I feel bad for my fellow T-Mobile employees that are going to have to deal with ignorant people the next few days. Before you go to the store, just realize this guys: The T-Mobile rep which you’re going to possibly yell at didn’t cause the Earthquake or had anything to do with your loss of service. S/He’s just there to sell you a phone/plan or send a warranty replacements, not magically make towers all better in a blink of an eye.
I guess what I’m getting at is this: treat others as you wished to be treated. If you are going to cancel your line because of this, don’t tear the person’s head off. I’m sure you don’t want some guy yelling at you when you’re at work for something beyond your control. Also reps might be more willing to give you compensation if you aren’t a total jerk.

I wasn’t going to reply to this but… you have No reason to call me an idiot, and I try not to take it personal but then I consider your impudence and ignorance at the same time. 
I’ve had Tmobile long before they where Tmobile, I pay next to nothing for my plan which is unlimited in all areas ! Guess its a perk for being loyal – but yourself as others have become sheep / shelling out a good % of your income for the latest and what you think is the Greatest. Your Iphone was down most likely because you might have gotten a wee bit too much Lotion on it.  If you take the time and re-read – I was asking what the trouble was with out any BS.  As for being happy I’m alive- HA an Earthquake / and possibly a Hurricane on the way hmmmm, I’d bet your clicking your Ruby Red Heels together hoping you can get out of Kansas or where ever you living your mundane existence Mr. FLIT BOY.  By the way – I have 4 phones 1 from each of the Major Players since Many depend on me and TMO was the only one down in the area I was dispatched to at the time and NO Damage in a 300 SQ/ M area.  Again I was just asking what happened and I did not need a Flit Boy to chime in.  Now go back and re-lube your Iphone so you can get on w/ your missed Valentines Date…

BB



Had a Verizon BB and TMO BB in Crystal City (2 miles from DC).  Unable to make voice calls or get online to check the WWW with normally expected speeds. SMS was slow and had to resend several.  However, my TMO picked up a WiFi signal and I was up and running circles around my VZW service. I was still able to use my TMO BB on my home wifi signal while the VZW floundered for a few hours. Wifi integration is key.  My vote easily goes to TMO on this major event.

6.0 may not be scary for you. For someone who’s never been in any kind of quake, I’m sure it could be pretty terrifying. Suppose you give those “silly east coast people” a break?






Maluzfinest



Thats bull crap, tmobile was down for hrs in the city. Lot of pll including me had problems






Xpress8609



Hey my phone don’t work .. of course its not its mother nature !!!! Man people can be so worthless ! Goes to show how people can be so ignorant !

If TmobilesUSA service in CA was interrupted every time we had a 6.0 or less,  we would never have service.  I thought it was law that cell towers had to have back-up power?  Someone at Tmobile needs to get CA Tmobile training on cell tower set up…  I could understand a hiccup, but hours of no service.  That’s is ridiculous…

That’s a good idea, it would be pretty embarrassing if you cant ask your friends if they “can hear you now?” during the apocalypse.

You’re an idiot, maybe your phone doesnt work because you have it turned off, my t-mobile phone was working while I couldnt place/receive calls on my AT&T phone.  You suck…

Bro youshould make a book just reading about the first first quake i was all into it






Jonesin1969



I am in DC and while I have text and phone, my 4g and all web access is down on my Sidekick. Nothing posted on TMobile forum that I can find.

This just in….   The USGS has determined that the epicenter of the earthquake was in a cemetery just outside of DC. The cause appears to be all of our founding fathers rolling over in their graves.






greg



So we’re sheep for shelling out a portion of our paycheck but you see nothing wrong with having 4 phones?






Wilma Flintstone



Are people on here really ranting and competing about how much stronger an Earthquake was that they lived through?
*Quad Facepalm*

how do you know lots of tmo ppl around you having issues if the phone doesn’t work? or were you just walking around asking who tmo service isn’t working? smh

why should someone have to explain to you why an earthquake caused in some case un needed congestion, such as calling someone to check if they felt the earthquake that you know they did, or a million people jumping to fb and twitter to tell their 40 second earthquake story . come on ppl theres two plus articles on the other companies that were having the same issue. just stop lol in the case of  a real disaster u won’t be able to use your phone period, what company will you be using then?






Persequi



To all those that think that the T-mobile outage was due to the earthquake, it was not.  There was NO OUTAGE!!!!  It was a lot of people calling at the same time.  That was it.  In one hour, full services was available.  SMS and email was available.  This was reminiscent of 9/11 when everyone made a call at the same time to find out what happened or if others were ok.  However, all emergency services were not affected and calls made by emergency crews went through with priority service as planned. 






Customer



While the problem may have been caused by high call volume, in light of past disasters and potential disasters, shouldn’t T-Mobile be prepared for this? Also, my service outage for both calls and text lasted nearly 4 hours.






IT Guy



It’s all about weighing costs and benefits.  From time to time in situations like this, there’s a spike that leads to the network being overloaded. 
They could double or triple the capacity “just in case”, but it’d cost a lot more to maintain it. I guarantee the same people complaining that their phones weren’t working normally for a few hours would be the same ones screaming about price increases.






Guest



My 4G and 3G has been out since immediate after the earthquake, too. Stuck on EDGE for 24 hours now and counting. Actually, for a period of like 5 hours immediately after the quake I had No Signal bars showing at all, even when I manually put it in to 2G mode to try to get on the older lessed used signals. Had to use UMA for Wi-Fi calling for a while there.

   MY apologies Greg and others didn’t mean to degrade anyone w/ the ‘sheep comment’ BUT-”I recall a time when people paid less than $30. a month TAXES INCLUDED. The home phone also had long Dist plan to call anywhere in the US-and home phones where either leased or you purchased a cheap $10 phone or a cordless phone for the house”- AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT-people where OUTRAGED when the monthly bill went up by an entire $1 or maybe $2 a month…
    In todays world people think nothing of it to shell out $300 – $450 for the latest and greatest phone and also adding another $80 to $140 a month for a plan, the 1st comment caught me at a bad time.
    And to clear things up- I have 5 phones- the 5th is a SAT phone which will work during anything but used only as last resort & real emergencies  and I only pay for 1 phone-which is my personal for family and friends etc.   Again I only asked a ? hoping for an honest answer, and yes I understand congestion and overload- but companies quickly point the blame to the earth quake or the snowstorm or the company coffee pot broke, or whatever- instead of saying “sorry our system is getting overloaded with everyone calling friends and family-and yes we need to update it so in the future it won’t be as bad.  <- That would be honest and real.  And again honestly the only phone that would not work was TMOB and the Tower behind me was still standing and it had power.   Thank You and GOODNITE

So let’s say you switch carriers and something goes wrong there too, does that mean you’re just gonna up and switch to yet another carrier? 
There’s going to be something going bad at some point with any carrier. Good luck

please tell me you have restarted your phone since than?

i was unable to send SMS and email while this outage was going on :*(

Yeah, many of my co-workers have Verizon and no one was making calls about 10-20 minutes after the quake struck.  We were about a mile outside of DC.  Service was back when I tried again at an hour after the quake on AT&T and Verizon.  My T-Mobile phone could not send text messages until around 8:00 PM; I don’t know when voice service came back up.

Hymnofmidnight



Didn’t have issues with my service. The article I read about the earthquake on Huffington stated Sprint and AT&T were the ones with towers down in nyc, and that Verizon/T-Mobile were just taxed by call volume.
