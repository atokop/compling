The — the biggest quake in the region in more than 100 years — struck near the small Virginia town of Mineral yesterday morning (Aug. 23). It then radiated outward, shaking the ground in dozens of states. Several nearby NASA research and administration centers felt the jolt. NASA headquarters in Washington, D.C., for example, was evacuated briefly yesterday, agency officials said. [] "Wow! An earthquake at NASA HQ in DC, and I thought technology was...

Florida Power & Light Company changed the Space Coast skyline on Aug. 22 by demolishing the most visible structures at its 42-acre, 45-year-old Cape Canaveral Power Plant. It is preparing to build the Cape Canaveral Next Generation Clean Energy Center, which will open in 2013. The Next Generation Clean Energy Center is expected to generate an additional $12 million in tax revenue in its first full year of operation: $5.3 million for Brevard County schools, $4.8 million for Brevard County; and $1.6 million for other taxing authorities. FPL's Next Generation Clean Energy Center will use about 33 percent less fuel per megawatt of power generated with advanced combined-cycle, natural gas technology capable of producing 1250 megawatts of electricity, or enough to power 250000 homes and businesses. Three sleeker stacks, half as high as those taken down today, will emit 88 percent fewer air particulates and 50 percent less carbon dioxide without any additional water or land use. In addition, the site is designed to meet US Green Building Council Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification and to feature rooftop solar panels and an electric car recharging station.

The film focuses on the historical and future significance of American manned space flight and the importance of the United States remaining on the forefront of space discovery. 'The 2nd Assassination of JFK' commemorates the Florida Coast's pivotal role in human space discovery. The future of the Space Program is examined through thought provoking interviews with astronauts, NASA engineers, residents of the Space Coast in Florida, among others. With massive budget cuts from previous and current US administrations, the country will coon be losing our collective and genius workforce at the Kennedy Space Center. '2nd Assassination of JFK' brings to light the uncertainties surrounding the future of America in space, and how this uncertainty could be one of our most costly mistakes.

www.facebook.com www.coasttocoastam.com Author and aerospace engineer Dr. Robert Zubrin spoke about the importance of space exploration, and colonizing Mars, as well as alternative energy solutions for the United States. As we enter into the post-Shuttle era, he expressed concern that with economic cutbacks, NASA may take a budget hit. One hope is that the Dragon spacecraft developed by Elon Musk's SpaceX company could be used to transport astronauts to the ISS. As he points out in the revised edition of his book The Case for Mars, NASA's robotics program has been a big success, and the data retrieved by the rovers confirmed his viewpoints, originally published in 1997, that the planet contains a large amount of water. A friendly competition between nations, like the Olympics, could be a good way to go about space exploration, in contrast to the Space Station, which in the spirit of cooperation has turned out to be slow and costly, he said. The Mars Society, which Zubrin is president of, is holding a conference, open to the public, this week in Dallas. Zubrin advocated for the wide-scale adoption of methanol as an alternative to gasoline. If cars were designed as flex fuel, the US could then make and market ethanol, adding about 5 million jobs to the economy, and relieving the country from the need for expensive, foreign oil, he argued. He supports HR 1687: The Open Fuel Standard Act of 2011, and suggested that people contact their congressional representatives to push <b>...</b>

1. Personal Information Collection and Use
We do not collect personally identifiable information about you, except when you provide it to us. For example, if you submit an inquiry to us or sign up for our newsletter, you may be asked to provide certain information such as your contact details (name, e-mail address, mailing address, etc.).

Except as otherwise disclosed in this Privacy Policy, we will use the information you provide us only for the purpose of responding to your inquiry or in connection with the service for which you provided such information. We may forward your contact information and inquiry to our affiliates and other divisions of our company that we feel can best address your inquiry or provide you with the requested service. We may also use the information you provide in aggregate form for internal business purposes, such as generating statistics and developing marketing plans. We may share or transfer such non-personally identifiable information with or to our affiliates, licensees, agents and partners.
We may retain other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Such third parties may be provided with access to personally identifiable information needed to perform their functions, but may not use such information for any other purpose.
In addition, we may disclose any information, including personally identifiable information, we deem necessary, in our sole discretion, to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal proceeding or governmental request.
