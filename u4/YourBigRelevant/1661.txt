Mongolia set for triple-listing $3bn coal IPO.
				August 31, 2011  Coal, Finance

The Mongolian government is heading for an unusual listing of its vast Tavan Tolgoi coal deposit on three exchanges: London, Hong Kong and Ulan Bator.

Coal deals burn investors: Bloomberg.
				August 31, 2011  Coal

A Peabody coal-mining acquisition leads a clutch of such coal deals that have subsequently tanked, Bloomberg notes. The rationale – hopes that costs will continue to rise from already high levels on Chinese steel demand – is not working.

EPA plans mean many new US coal plants may never be built.
				August 29, 2011  Coal

New EPA regulations could  force up to 20 per cent of US coal plants to shut down, according to the coal industry. The American Legislative Exchange Council talks of an impending upheaval as a “train wreck” of lost jobs, higher prices and blackouts. The Congressional Research Office is more relaxed.

				August 29, 2011  Climate, Oil

The Canadians will exploit the tar sands anyway, so there will be no increase in emissions as a result of the 1,700 mile 700,000 barrel a day pipeline, which will have minimal other environmental impacts, says a State Department official.

China tips the global auto population over 1 billion.
				August 24, 2011  Oil

China is now a bigger market than the US. Chinese consumers show little preference for green cars. While SUV sales surge, Toyota sold only one Prius last year. On these trends, there would be more cars in China in 2030 than in the whole world in 2000.

US solar bankruptcies: a shakeout, not a meltdown.
