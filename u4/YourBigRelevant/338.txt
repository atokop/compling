@Polydynamix
Exactly the point. So, so, soooo many on the far left certainly do, or did until they discovered HE wasn't
Again off point aren't﻿ we with ignoring what doesn't agree?
Just sayn'

@Polydynamix
Would you like just one example of Obama's open and uncontrolled﻿ hatred?
Remember that HE sent a bust of Churchill back to England in Feb 2009
Now why was that?
OOPS, guess your answer will be that HE's only human even tho HE's the messiah

@Polydynamix hoooeeee, you've no idea & clearly punting
Bush & family did NOT take taxpayer paid vacations all around the world. His wife didn't tell Americans to watch their diets & eat their veggies, but then chow down on the best of the best. Bush cleared the brush on his vacations, 180 of them(?) but didn't send his pets by private cargo aircraft to them
Having said that, Bush was a robot & let 911﻿ strike
I'm not a child letting hate control & blind me. I try to look with eyes open

@Searching4Truth1 I simply meant that your disdain has focus. You are not angry at bush because he took too many vacations, or because he didn't﻿ write his own speeches- you're frustration comes with purpose, as a result of his actions.
But seriously tho, just because you've excluded hate from your vocabulary doesn't mean you don't feel it, you are human are you not?

@Polydynamix
Perhaps you would﻿ expand on your comment?
Personally hate is not in my vocabulary

@Searching4Truth1 No there's hate with a purpose. That's﻿ what I like to see.

hmmm, perhaps a lip reader could﻿ tell us what HE's saying

@Polydynamix No problem golfing but .. .
"The problem is, is that the way Bush has done it over the last eight years is to take out a credit card from the Bank of China in the name of our children, driving up our national debt from $5 trillion for the first 42 presidents - #43 added $4 trillion by his lonesome, so that we now have over $9 trillion of debt that we are going to﻿ have to pay back, $30,000 for every man, woman and child. That's irresponsible. It's unpatriotic." ~BHO - July 3, 08
