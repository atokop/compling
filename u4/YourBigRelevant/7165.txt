Felt reports from this aftershock :
Charlottesville, VA : 5:09na 8 seconds of light shaking – enough to rattle the windows, wake us, and the dogs.
Locust Grove, VA – Lasted approx 20 – 30 sec
Spotsylvania, VA – Felt like the house was going over rumble strips on the highway…lasted about 30 sekundy.
Scottsville, VA – Lasted perhaps 7 alebo 8 sekundy.
New Canton, VA – I had just awoken and felt the house shake. There was a slight "boom" as if something had hit the house and then I heard the windowframes rattling and heard the rumble.  This is the 4th aftershock I have felt/heard at home since the quake last week.
Montpelier, VA – Awakened by loud rumbling sound.
Oldenburg, IN – I was in bed and it was shaking slightly–for what felt like a very long minute. I looked at my clock and saw it was 5:10 na (ER : Hard to believe as we speak of a distance to the epicenter of 400 km!)
Cartersville, VA : We have been getting moderate shaking every night since the bigger Quake.They sound like train coal cars stopping, lots of banging the louder the bang the worst in the shaken of the house. It goes by with the loudest bang with a lifting or wave and then slowly the banging goes away in the distance ,like a train going down the train tracks.
Nelson, VA : Rattled my windows.
Richmond, VA : At approximately 5 am this morning, Sept 1, my husband and I woke up as our ceiling fan and windows were shaking for about 30 seconds.  It was pretty strong to wake us up but not enough for us to run out of the house.
Goochland County, VA : Felt quake around 5 am this morning. Had to straighten pictures on the wall again!
Petersburg, VA : Ä˝ahkĂ˝ tras
Alexandria, VA : Woke up to its effect of causing large mirror to fall and shatter in bathroom.
Manakin Sabot, VA : It was about 5:10 this morning…I woke up to my bed shaking and the house rattling. A very disturbing thing to wake up to!
Lake Monticello, VA : Awakened suddenly by fairly strong rumbling & shaking a little after 5 na. Septembra 1, 2011.
Unionville, VA : My clock said 5:04 but its all the same.. loud rumble, lasted about half a minute or so and the shaking of the walls and floors last almost as long.. I heard the rumble a few seconds before i felt the house shake. So, i got up and checked on everyone and i was the only one who was woke up from the loud rumble.
So i went back to bed and said man i hope thats the end of it… That is the third one to wake me from a dead sleep. The one just before 1:00 am and the one the next morning just after 1:00 am last week were the first two to wake me up out of 3 times total. Now i just wish i knew it was the end of it! as i don't like them at night!! LOL.
AktualizovaĹĽ 29/08 – 11:48  PM Local time :  Another aftershock going along with some light shaking has struck the Virginia earthquake area.  Epicenter on almost the same location than the mainshock, close to Mineral and Louisa.
	Rozsah : 2.6 @ a depth of 8.5 km. 48 km (29 km) ESE z Charlottesville, Virginia and 56 km (34 km) SW Fredericksburg, Virginie.
Felt sprĂĄvy(s) :
Charlotteville, Va : In Charlottesville near Pantops area, August 30th I felt another tremor around 11:20pm last night, August 29th…..lasted about 10 seconds.  Did anyone else feel it? – MMI III
AktualizovaĹĽ 27/08 – 11:16  PM Local time :  A weak 2.7 magnitude aftershock struck the area at a depth of 5.1 km at 11:16 PM on August 27.  The epicenter was located closest to Louisa a Mineral a 42 km from Charlottesville, VA
Felt Reports from this aftershock :
Orange, VA – I felt a very weak aftershake in Gordonsville, Orange County, VA, at around 11:30 or so. Gordonsville is located only a short distance from Mineral which was the epicenter of last week's earthquake, and I have felt several aftershakes since then. Every time there is an aftershake, I can hear the underground explosion, but the sound is extremely low. I think we also had an aftershake earlier this evening, though I am not 100% sure. I am, however, positive that we had an aftershake at 11:30 here in Gordonsville. Even my cat reacted visibly to it. – MMI III
Fluvanna, VA – MMI VI Strong shaking indicated. (ER : Fluvanna is situated approx. 20 km od epicentra)
Fluvanna, VA – At about 11:10 p.m. Sunday the 28th. We are real close to Louisa County Virginia.  O 2 miles south of US 250 east . Two tremors back to back
AktualizovaĹĽ : So far we have received I Have Felt It reports with a max. mierny tras (V MMI), which corresponds with the theoretical USGS values. A V MMI is described as a moderate shaking with possible light damage at vulnerable buildings. Light damage is like cracks in walls, fallen tiles, atÄ.
AktualizovaĹĽ : Aftershocks likes this one are perfectly normal after a 5.9 zemetrasenie. Occasionally an isolated 5+ quake might be possible too. A greater aftershock than the initial 5.9 is also possible, but the chance on it is very exceptional.
AktualizovaĹĽ :  Based on the many Felt reports we are receiving we do expect at max. some additional minimal damage within a radius of 5 km od epicentra (which means Cuckoo alone).
AktualizovaĹĽ : Epicenter of the earthquake below Cuckoo and approx. 8 km from Mineral
AktualizovaĹĽ : according to the theoretical calculations of USGS the max. Felt experience will be a moderate shaking : V MMI

Mineral, Va – Was real short, but felt rather violent.  Not sustained like the main earthquake.  Was like a 2 sec. heavy shake or more like a jump feeling for me, like i bounced up outta my couch, then just the dull roar sound with minimal vibration as if bass speakers were maxed – MMI IV

Bethesda, MA – Felt this one too, my watch showed 1:09 AM EST by the time tremors ended. Felt it all, just like the one on Tuesday, as I was sitting in my bed, working on the laptop, just as Tuesday. Considering earthquakes are not very common for this area, was pretty scary. The noise of the windows vibrating here in the house was creepy, both earlier and on Tuesday … One of the 2 cats started miaowing aggresively right after the quake. – V
Towson, MD – I felt week shaking about 1:10 am Thursday 8/25/2011.  I was laying in bed. It was for few seconds, was going to wake up everybody in the  house as I realized what it was but then it stopped – III

McLean, VA – Ä˝ahkĂ˝ tras uvedenĂŠ – MMI IV
Maryland, Aspen Hill - Sitting in my living room around 1am, I felt light trembling similar to what we experienced July 2010 when a 3.4 magnitude tremor occurred with epicenter about 20 miles from my house.  Sounded like a large truck speeding by but I live on a narrow side street that would not have that type of traffic that time of night – III
Richmond, Virginie – I felt the aftershock of the earthquake early this morning; I watched as my iron danced about half an inch from its original position on my ironing board in my room. The picture frames shook too, but there was no damage to anything. It sounded like a caravan of 18-wheeler trucks drove by right outside the window. I thought it was another earthquake, because I could feel it shaking from deep within my chest, which does not occur when a truck or something big goes by. My roommate, who was down the hall, didn't feel anything – III

We've read that this aftershock was a 4.8 and located close the original epicenter – V
Eldersburg, MD – I was awakened on 5/24 at approx 12:45 a.m. and on 5/25 at approx. 1:07 a.m. by the rattle of the doors on an old stand in my bedroom.  I did not feel any shaking in the bed, just heard the rattle of the doors that woke me up. I have lived in this house 16 years and never experienced such rattle.  III: Weak Shaking
Bethesda, MA – Felt this one too, my watch showed 1:09 AM EST by the time tremors ended. Felt it all, just like the one on Tuesday, as I was sitting in my bed, working on the laptop, just as Tuesday. Considering earthquakes are not very common for this area, was pretty scary. The noise of the windows vibrating here in the house was creepy, both earlier and on Tuesday … One of the 2 cats started miaowing aggresively right after the quake. – V

Monroe, Va – Woke me up, Strong aftershock felt about 1:08 a.m. in Monroe, Va. for a couple of seconds.
Baltimore, MD – I was finally drifting to sleep after 24 hours of sleeplessness and suddenly jolted awake as the bed shook and several things in my bedroom moved across their shelves. In other parts of our home small items were out of place or knocked over. Not nearly as bad as Tuesday's quake but I certainly won't be sleeping well for a while… – IV
Apple Grove, VA – We are 3 miles from the epicenter.  Before the quake there were 2 light, short tremors.  One around midnight, the next just a few minutes before – V
White Oak, Montgomery County, MD – I was awakened at 1:08 am by light-to-moderate shaking, and realized immediately that we were experiencing an aftershock.  I was not in the same location (my bed) when the original quake occurred, so I cannot compare the two events (in fact, I was walking around downtown Rockville, MD, and didn't detect it at all), however, the intensity and duration of this event was slighty less than what I felt last year when I was also awakened from sleep by an earthquake which was centered in Germantown, MD. – IV
Mineral VA – I was a sleep and the house started shaking and rumbling again.  It was about 1:06 na, will this soon stop? – MMI VI (Strong Shaking)

Lynchburg, VA – Awakened just after 1 AM Thursday a.m. by shaking and by very strange house sounds…nothing I can liken to anything I've heard in the house before (and I wasn't at home for the Tuesday afternoon quake).  Shaking was continuous but house sounds came in several waves over several seconds.  At its peak, I also heard a noise from outside…possibly our deck rattling – V
Reston, VA – 1:07 am August 25, 2011 – same sound and shaking for about 10 sekundy – V
Alexandria, VA – 1:08 AM Thursday, August 25.  The house-shaking-noise was minor this time, but I felt the movement under my feet as I was sitting at my computer.  The dogs did not react this time at all, but it was still unsettling (it lasted quite awhile). – IV
Bumpass, VA – I live just outside the epicenter area and last night i woke up at 1:08 to my house shaking.. it felt like how a cheap hotel would shake as a train goes by. it was strong enough to wake me but not major. basically just vibrated my house. – IV-V
Stafford - Woke me up at about 1:08.  Everyone else slept through it – V
Amherst, Viginia – IV MMI indicated (svetlo trasie)

Woodbridge, VA – I woke up to slight shaking at 1:08 na. It lasted about 15 sekundy- time for me to wake up, get out of bed, and move to my door – IV
Mineral, VA – I live 3 miles from the center of that aftershock and I thought tt wasn't as long as bad as the 4.2 from the night before.  It is all the little rumbling all night long that makes it interesting. – V MMI
Stafford VA – I heard a long (maybe 30 sekundy) low steady rumbling at 12:45. My time seems to be off from everyone else so I am wondering if I am wrong? It was either an aftershock or Marine Base Quantico doing some sort of bombing at that time of the morning, which I doubt. I got up to look around – nothing shaking, just vibrating with this low rumbling. It lasted too long to be a low flying plane or truck rumbling by, so I guess aftershock – III
Fredericksburg, Va -  I was sleeping and woke up because of the shaking. Definitely not as strong as a few days ago, but enough to wake me up. I sat up and looked at my phone, it was 1:10na – MMI III
Toano Virginie – I noticed rattling while laying in bed then heard my closet doors rattle and felt the bed shake around 1:10 – V
Falmouth, Virginie – Felt shaking 1:09 na, ceiling fans and overhead light rattling, bots slept through it – IV

Tappahannock VA – We felt the aftershock it rattled our ceilings
Cockeysville/Hunt Valley, Maryland – I was in bed and it was exactly 1:09 a.m August 25th.  It woke me up and there appeared to be lines running across the TV.    But i sure felt it. I looked at the clock for the time.  It did not last as long as the Earthquake on Tuesday, Aug. 23rd – MMI VI
Fredericksburg, Va – I was sleeping and woke up because of the shaking. Definitely not as strong as a few days ago, but enough to wake me up. I sat up and looked at my phone, it was 1:10na – III
Triangle, VA – MMI IV = light shaking
Rockville, MD – Watching TV in bed when room started to shake for about 5-10 seconds at 1:09na. Nothing too crazy – MMI IV
Roanoke, VA – August 25, 2011–1:09 na–was in bed and the bed swayed for a couple of seconds. – IV
Green Bay VA – I was sitting on my couch watching tv around 1am and the house started shaking. Unlike the initial quake this one made the dishes in my cabinets rattle. It lasted maybe 20-30 seconds but didn't wake anyone else in the house up. This one was quieter than the initial one as well. There was an aftershock or something a few hours after the one on the 23rd but even though everyone was awake nobody felt it but me and my dogs. I barely even felt it. – III
Bumpass, VA – 11:27 am felt short aftershock about 4 sekundy….just want it to stop. We are just a few short miles from Mineral, where our kids attend school. Still unsettling! – MMI IV

Crystal City, VA – Slight aftershock at 1:08na, 1:14, a 1:20am.  House made sounds like with a strong wind blowing. Nothing fell off shelfs as they did during earthquake.  Getting kind of stressed over it. Not moving to West coast! – III
MD - Woke up at about 1 AM by my beagle whimpering and digging at her crate. Shaking started afterward – V
Clifton, Virginie – Our family was sleeping around 1:00 a:m.  I awoke to the bed shaking and instantly knew it was an aftershock. My husband felt it as well. Our children said they were not awakened by it.  It was not anywhere close to what we experienced on Tuesday but I would describe it as light to moderate shaking.  I'm sure it would have seemed greater if you were awake and standing or sitting rather than lying down when it occurred. – V
Mineral VA – Crazy Like the beginning of the 5.9 but stopped much quicker! Thank goodness – V
Alexandria, VA – Last night, just after 1 a.m., I was awoken by shaking. It felt like a train was going by the house. I woke up my husband and told him I thought we were experiencing an aftershock. He said I was crazy and told me to go back to sleep. Of course, as usual, I was right. – V
East Greenbush, NY -  MMI III (slabĂ˝ tras) indicated.
Gettysburg, PA – I was on a horseback tour of the Gettysburg National Battlefield at 1:10 pm today (August 25) when my horse and at least three in front of me all stumbled (on flat ground) at the same time.  I was wondering if it was because of an aftershock of the Mineral, VA quake.  Thanks. – MMI III
Arlington VA – A little after 1 am I was lying in bed upstairs in a two story house in northwest Arlington, reading.  Heard a low hum and then felt light to moderate shaking, doors rattling gently in door frames, bed rocking very slightly–much like a train were going by a few houses away.  Not sure how long it went on, but more than 5 seconds.  Did not wake my husband or son. – IV
Culpeper, VA – yo estaba acostada en mi coma cuando de repente empeso a bibrrar muy rapido y pense q era la labadora pero me quede pensando yo no estoy labando y de repente empeso a moberse toda la casa y lo unico q se me bino en mente esq era un tenblor senti muvho miedo por mis hijos.

the other room, but said he did not feel anything. It lasted about 10 sekundy. – MMI IV
Burke, Virginie – I was in the living room when the aftershock happened. My family members who were asleep didn't really notice it. – MMI III
Erie, Pa – We are in the second story of a office building and one of the plants started shaking and then you could hear the filing cabinets squeaking against eachother. Most people in our office didnt feel it unless they were touching their desks or some other big object. Just before 11am for about 20 sekundy. – MMI III
Ashland, Va – On 23rd I was in Richmond, Va. at Krogers. I started my car because it was so hot and put my groceries in. I noticed that the car was shaking like it had an engine problem and my only worry was "how I was going to fix it". No thought of an erthquake. But on 8/25 at a few minutes after 1:00AM I was at the computer when my chair began to shake and the fax machine(which was not on) began to do it's thing. It was really scary.
Was it an aftershock or another earthquake? (Definitely an aftershock ER)
Greenville, MI – My little terrier was sleeping between my wife and I, when at approximately 1am, she began to whimper and yip quietly, waking me up.  I tried to calm her, thinking she needed to go out, perhaps.  She kept up this behavior for almost ten minutes, then settled down and went back to sleep.  In the meantime, I began to feel my bed vibrate lightly, then growing stronger to the point where I could feel it actually trembling, then subduing over the course of about two minutes.  I awoke my wife, but she had felt nothing.  The next morning, the news mentioned an aftershock had occurred early that morning.  I can only assume that is what I felt. – MMI III
Fredericksburg, VA – I woke up to the house shaking.  The windows rattled and some CD's fell off the shelf.  This was quicker than the first one. – MMI VI
Lynchburg, VA – Sounded like wind was picking up, walls started making creaking noises, bed started rocking. – MMI III
Arlington VA  – A little after 1 am I was lying in bed upstairs in a two story house in northwest Arlington, reading.  Heard a low hum and then felt light to moderate shaking, doors rattling gently in door frames, bed rocking very slightly–much like a train were going by a few houses away.  Not sure how long it went on, but more than 5 seconds.  Did not wake my husband or son. – MMI IV
Madison Heights, VA – about 1:00 am ish heard strange noise, like train rumbling, lasting 15-30 secs, dogs down street started barking prior to rumbling sound, just an eerie feeling, house made noises like settling ceiling made cracking sounds, walls made noises. The train sound is common, since trains hook up in lynchburg everyday, assuming is not always what it is.
Columbia, SC – Sitting on the sofa with someone. They thought I was shaking the sofa. Lasted about a minute. – MMI III
Ashland Virginie – Sitting on the couch after dinner I heard rumbling and shaking. My attention turned to the window and it crossed my mind what if then I remembered that a train amtrack runs through thye center of Ashland.Virginia. It crossed my mind that it was an aftershock but I thought probably the train and would I ever get over the fear of a Earthquake every time I heard a train always listning for the whistle is now a constant reassuring sound I lookout for . Resigned to the fact that it was a train I put it out of my mind and went about watching a show on TV. So it really wasnt a surprise that I found out from my friend we had a aftershock and I guessed it was about a 4 pretty lucky guess it was a 4.5 I am getting pretty good at guessing the Richter scale,Earthquakes and a Hurricane all in one week do I dare ask what next? well it all could of been much worse but prayers going out to all the peopke adversly affected. We just have to be prepared these days for any thing and make sure we don't take anything or those close to us for granted. – V MMI
Reston, VA – 4 AM in Reston, VA. A/C is off, & I am the only one up. Definitely felt house shaking–still feeling it. Long time this time. Subtle, but present – MMI IV

Lake Monticello, Virginie: A little after 5 na. Septembra 1, 2011 – awakened by the now familiar slow rumble getting louder and louder as well as shaking lasting a few seconds – not sure exactly how to get used to this.

I know you find it hard to believe I felt it in Indiana, but that’s what was so….gentle rocking and noticing the time 5:10 and then reading that an aftershock happened at 5:09. When the 1st one happened on 8/23, people felt it near my area and even further west though I can’t say I felt anything then.

I am located in Grandy, NC and felt a light tremor lasting not more than 2-3 seconds at 3:40 a.m. What is the likelyhood that this was an aftershock? Have there been any other reports or signs of activity? I realize not many people would be awake at this time to make such a report, but the first time it happened I felt a strong shaking for about 8-10 sekundy. I questioned whether it was just me and said nothing. Now I can’t help but wonder.
