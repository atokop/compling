here is the article by Deborah Dupre: " www.examiner.com " A situation is gaining national interest due to investigative journalist and human rights defender known as Dutch Since, who specializes in HAARP weather warfare and unmistakably predicted this week's series of deadly southland's storms with extraordinary accuracy. He allegedly bases his predictions on HAARP rings and scaler squares that he documents on video using official US data. On the 26th, Since presented geo-engineering information in a video that indicated areas in the south that would be hit. Over 250 people perished in the storms. ("Watch terrifying tornado footage from southern storms," Yahoo) Geo-engineering, the artificial modification of the earth's climate systems, is an environment modification (ENMOD) science for "deliberate manipulation of natural processes - the dynamics, composition or structure of the Earth, including its biota, lithosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere, or of outer space that can be applied as a weapon of mass destruction."

Our Ocean Planet- As seen from above, Earth is one watery world and home to some remarkable creatures. The new dolphin show, Our Ocean Planet, explores the depths of these waters by exploring a dolphin's world. All of the water on Earth is connected. Even the water in your neighborhood is, ultimately, connected to the ocean. A watershed is a network of rivers and streams that connect to an estuary or bay, which then leads to the ocean. Your own backyard is part of a watershed. What you do at home affects the larger watershed and, eventually, the dolphin's home: the ocean. Explore a dolphin's world inside, and learn how ocean health starts with us. Simple steps can make a difference.

Death Threats to Atheists on Fox's Facebook Page

Cross at World Trade Center Memorial is not as benign as many Christians would have you believe--all the more reason it has no place in the memorial. Death threats aimed at American Atheists populated the Fox News Facebook page after Blair Scott, Communications Director for American Atheists, appeared on America Live with Megyn Kelly Thursday. Scott's appearance on Fox News was motivated by the recent complaint filed by American Atheists and others with the state of New York asking for fair and equal treatment by the National September 11 Memorial and Museum. American Atheists argue that inclusion of the 9/11 cross and the exclusion of representations suitable to non-Christians constitutes a violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States. Apparently for many self identified Christians, the request by atheists for fair and equal treatment under the law was too much to handle. The explosion of hate coming off the Fox News Facebook page is alarming. As one might expect, freethinkers and atheists are deeply uncomfortable with the death threats. American Atheists report that moderators on the Fox News Facebook page had been trying diligently to delete the violent threats, but not before they were screen-captured by a diligent American Atheists member named Robert Posey. (For screen shots of just a few of the death theats that have been preserved, please see the slide show.) Continue reading on Examiner.com Atheists face death threats <b>...</b>
