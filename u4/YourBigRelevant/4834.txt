Famous Sayings About Teachers
"Teaching is not a lost art, but the regard for it is a lost tradition." - Jacques Barzun 
"Good teachers are costly, but bad teachers cost more." - Bob Talbert 
"The true teacher defends his pupils against his own personal influence. He inspires self-distrust. He guides their eyes from himself to the spirit that quickens him. He will have no disciple." - Amos Bronson Alcott 
"A good teacher is like a candle - it consumes itself to light the way for others." -Anonymous 
"Teaching is leaving a vestige of one self in the development of another. And surely the student is a bank where you can deposit your most precious treasures." - Eugene P. Bertin 
"The mediocre teacher tells. The good teacher explains. The superior teacher demonstrates. The great teacher inspires." - William Arthur Ward 
"A teacher's purpose is not to create students in his own image, but to develop students who can create their own image." - Anonymous

"The dream begins with a teacher who believes in you, who tugs and pushes and leads you to the next plateau, sometimes poking you with a sharp stick called truth." - Dan Rather 
"In teaching you cannot see the fruit of a day's work. It is invisible and remains so, maybe for twenty years." - Jacques Barzun 
"Teaching is the profession that teaches all the other professions." - Anonymous 
"The best teachers teach from the heart, not from the book." - Anonymous 
"A teacher affects eternity; he can never tell where his influence stops." - Henry Brooks Adams 
"Teachers, I believe, are the most responsible and important members of society because their professional efforts affect the fate of the earth." - Helen Caldicott 
"Better than a thousand days of diligent study is one day with a great teacher." -Japanese proverb 
"The whole art of teaching is only the art of awakening the natural curiosity of young minds for the purpose of satisfying it afterwards." -Anatole France

"A gifted teacher is as rare as a gifted doctor, and makes far less money" - Anonymous

शिक्षकों दिन день учителя 教师节 World Teachers' day-Sep 5 India,Russia,China!










букет на день учителя
“Matha Pitha Guru Deivam” 
 माता, पिता, गुरु, देवम्
Mother Father Teacher God.
is a very popular adage or phrase in Sanskrit. 

meaning says first mother, then father, then teacher, and only after all of them, God. In traditional Hindu gurukuls.

or 

Mother, Father and Teachers are our God!

"My Teacher My Hero" 
I chose this special present because I wanted you to know, 
That I'm grateful for your hard work in helping me to grow. 
For your constant understanding and for always being there, 
To tell me I can do it and to show me that you care!


God understood our thirst for 
knowledge, and our need to be led 
by someone wiser; 
He needed a heart of compassion, 
of encouragement, and patience; 
Someone who would accept 
the challenge regardless of the 
opposition; 
Someone who could see potential 
and believe in the best in others . . . 
So He made Teachers. 

Teachers Paint their minds and guide their thoughts Share their achievements and advise their faults 
Inspire a Love of knowledge and truth As you light the path Which leads our youth 
For our future brightens with each lesson you teach Each smile you lengthen Each goal you help reach 
For the dawn of each poet each philosopher and king Begins with a Teacher And the wisdom they bring.
World Teachers' Day is celebrated across the world on October 5.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saraswati
In Hinduism Saraswati (Sanskrit: सरस्वती, Sarasvatī ?, Tamil: சரஸ்வதி,Sarasvatī ?, is the goddess of knowledge, music, arts, science and technology. She is the consort of Brahma. Saraswati is considered to be the "mother of theVedas".

The name Saraswati came from "saras" (meaning "flow") and "wati" (meaning "a woman"). So, Saraswati is symbol of knowledge; its flow (or growth) is like a river and knowledge is supremely alluring, like a beautiful woman.

Saraswati is known as a guardian deity in Buddhism who upholds the teachings ofGautama Buddha by offering protection and assistance to practitioners. She is known in Burmese as Thurathadi (သူရဿတီ, pronounced [θùja̰ðədì] or [θùɹa̰ðədì]) or TipitakaMedaw (တိပိဋကမယ်တော်, pronounced [tḭpḭtəka̰ mɛ̀dɔ̀]), Chinese as Biàncáitiān (辯才天), in Thai as Surasawadee (สุรัสวดี) and in Japanese as Benzaiten (弁才天/弁財天).

In the East Indian states of Bihar, West Bengal, Orissa Saraswati is considered to be a daughter of Durga along with her sister Lakshmi and her brothers Ganesha and Karthikeya.

Saraswati Temple in Bali, Indonesia.

Mythology

In the Rigveda, Saraswati is a river as well as its personification as a goddess. In the post-Vedic age, she began to lose her status as a river goddess and became increasingly associated with literature, arts, music, etc. In Hinduism, Saraswati represents intelligence, consciousness, cosmic knowledge, creativity, education, enlightenment, music, the arts, eloquence and power. Hindus worship her not only for "academic knowledge", but for "divine knowledge" essential to achieve moksha.

In some Puranas (like Skanda Purana) she is daughter of Shiva (Shivaanujaa) and in someTantras with Ganesha.

The original (spiritual) forms of devas including Saraswati are present in the spiritual world:

In the center reside the deities of fire, sun and moon, Kurma-avatara, Ananta Sesha, andGaruda, the master of the three Vedas. The Vedic hymns and all sacred mantras also stay in that holy place, which is made of all the Vedas, and which is known in the Smriti-sastra [Scriptures of Remembrance] as the yoga-pitha [Sanctuary of Union]. (Padma Purana Uttara-khanda 256.23)

Accompanied by Lakshmi and other associates, the chatur-vyuha [Four Expansions] headed by Lord Vasudeva are manifest in the eight directions, beginning with the east. In the directions beginning with the southeast, the palaces of Lakshmi, Saraswati, Rati, and Kanti respectively are situated.[clarification needed]

According to Vedanta she is considered to be the feminine energy and knowledge aspect (Shakti) of Brahman, as one of many aspects of Adi Shakti.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teachers'_Day

In some countries, 'Teachers' Days' are intended to be special days for the appreciation of teachers. World Teachers' Day is celebrated across the world on October 5. Ever since the importance of teachers has been recognized by UNESCO, by adopting the “Recommendation concerning the status of teachers”, World Teachers' Day has been celebrated annually. This includes celebrations to honor the teachers for their special contribution in a particular field area or the community in general.

The idea of celebrating Teacher's Day took ground independently in many countries during the XX century; in most cases, they celebrate a local educator or an important milestone in education (for example, Argentina celebrates Domingo Faustino Sarmiento's death on September 11 since 1915, while India celebrates Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan's birthday on September 5 since 1962). These two factors explain why almost all countries celebrate this day on different dates, unlike many other International Days.


Dr sarvepalli RadhakrishnanPresident of India
In office
13 May 1962 – 13 May 1967 
http://www.iloveindia.com/indian-heroes/sarvepalli-radhakrishnan.html
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarvepalli_Radhakrishnan

Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan pronunciation (help·info), OM, FBA (Telugu: సర్వేపల్లి రాధాకృష్ణ 5 September 1888 – 17 April 1975) born in Tiruttani of Tamil Nadu State in India, was an Indian philosopher and statesman. He was the first Vice President of India (1952–1962) and subsequently the second President of India (1962–1967).

One of India's most influential scholars of comparative religion and philosophy, Radhakrishnan is thought of having built a bridge between the East and the West by showing that the philosophical systems of each tradition are comprehensible within the terms of the other. He wrote authoritative exegeses of India's religious and philosophical literature for the English speaking world. His academic appointments included the King George V Chair of Mental and Moral Science at the University of Calcutta (1921–?) andSpalding Professor of Eastern Religion and Ethics at Oxford University (1936–1952).

Among the many honours he received were a knighthood (1931), the Bharat Ratna (1954) and the Order of Merit in 1963. His birthday is celebrated in India as Teachers' Day on 5 September.

Rio de janeiro, Brazil





Sea of Humanity, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil














Brazil
Coordinates: 22°54′30″S 43°11′47″W 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro

Rio de Janeiro (English pronunciation: /riːoʊ deɪ ʒəˈnɛəroʊ/ or /ˈriːoʊ deɪ dʒəˈnɛəroʊ/;local Portuguese pronunciation: [ˈʁiu dʒi ʒaˈnejɾu],[1] River of January), commonly referred to simply as Rio, is the capital city of the State of Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city of Brazil, and the third largest metropolitan area and agglomeration in South America, 6th largest in the Americas, and 26th in the world.

The city was the capital of Brazil for nearly two centuries, from 1763 to 1815 during the Portuguese colonial era, 1815 to 1821 as the capital of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and Algarves, 1822 to 1960 as an independent nation. Rio is nicknamed the Cidade Maravilhosa or "Marvelous City".

Rio de Janeiro represents the second largest GDP in the country (and 30th largest in the world in 2008), estimated at about 343 billion reais (IBGE/2008) (nearly US$201 billion), and is the headquarters of two major Brazilian companies –Petrobras and Vale, and major oil companies and telephony in Brazil, besides the largest conglomerate of media and communications companies in Latin America, the Globo Organizations. The home of many universities and institutes, it is the second largest center of research and development in Brazil, accounting for 17% of national scientific production – according to 2005 data.

Rio de Janeiro is the most visited city in southern hemisphere and is known for its natural settings, carnival celebrations, samba, Bossa Nova, and balneariobeaches such as Barra da Tijuca, Copacabana, Ipanema, and Leblon. Some of the most famous landmarks in addition to the beaches include the giant statue ofChrist the Redeemer ('Cristo Redentor') atop Corcovado mountain, named one of theNew Seven Wonders of the World; Sugarloaf mountain (Pão de Açúcar) with its cable car; the Sambódromo, a permanent grandstand-lined parade avenue which is used during Carnival; and Maracanã Stadium, one of the world's largest football stadiums. The 2016 Summer Olympics will take place in Rio de Janeiro, which will mark the first time a South American city hosts the event.[10] Rio's Maracanã Stadium will also host the final match for 2014 FIFA World Cup. Rio de Janeiro will also host World Youth Day in 2013.

Singapore imposes new standards for air-con, refrigerators.






KUALA LUMPUR (Sept 2, 2011): Malaysian exporters and manufacturers must comply immediately with the minimum energy performance standards imposed by Singapore, effective Sept 1, 2011, to ensure continued market access for air-conditioners and refrigerators in the city state.


In a statement today, the Malaysia External Trade Development Corp (Matrade) said manufacturers and exporters who supplied household air-cons and refrigerators in Singapore must also register themselves with the country’s National Environment Agency (NEA).

Matrade said the air-con and refrigerator models must also be registered and carry a certificate of registration, valid for three years.

"Once this policy comes into force, all importers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers, property developers and contractors must ensure that their units are affixed with the NEA’s energy label," it said.

It said to remain competitive in the market, Malaysian companies must be wary of the possible additional cost to be incurred following the implementation of the standards.

"Apart from the registration fee (currently at S$34 [RM84]) and renewal fees (S$18 [RM44]) for each registrable product, additional costs will be incurred when carrying out the necessary tests at the approved testing laboratories," it said.

MEPS is prescribed in Singapore government’s environment protection and management regulations.

These standards are specified according to the types of goods, cooling capacity (in kW), minimum coefficient of performance, adjusted volume and maximum annual energy consumption (in kW). –Bernama

Computer History Museum, California, USA - Architecture






© Mark Richards & Mark Horton / Architecture

The birthplace of Pong. The home of Facebook. The epicenter of the Cloud.

Mark Horton / Architecture (MH/A)’s renovation of an existing former Silicon Graphics office building in Mountain View, California, into the new home of the Computer History Museum is genius loci made physical.

Architect: Mark Horton / Architecture

Project Team: Mark Horton, Principal; Daniel Mason, Project Architect

Location: Mountain View, California, USA

Project Year: 2011

Project Area: 25,000 sqf Primary Exhibition Space; 6,000 sqf Multi-use lobby / café / reception / gift shop

Photographs: Mark Richards, Ethan Kaplan Photography, Daniel Mason, Mark Horton / Architecture


© Ethan Kaplan Photography & Mark Horton / Architecture

The transformation of the first floor of the building into a new entrance hall and orientation theater, a café and bookstore, and a 25,000 sqf exhibition space housing Revolution : The First 2000 Years of Computing is the perfect re-use of a formerly high-flying computer company in the perfect location.


© Ethan Kaplan Photography & Mark Horton / Architecture

Surrounded by a who’s who of computing – Google, Apple, HP, Cisco- the Computer History Museum attempts to document a work-in-progress. Exhibiting everything from an ENIAC to an Enigma Machine, from an early (wooden) computer mouse (1963) to the first mechanical and programmable computer – the Babbage Difference Engine (designed in 1821), and from an Apple 1 to a Palm Pilot, the museum is a testament to the exponential evolution of computing and the truth of Moore’s Law.

The architectural transformation of the front portion of the existing building into an inviting and sophisticated lobby is the initial experience of the museum-goer. Semi-public amenities, including a café and a bookstore, reinforce this initial impression. An orientation theater and a transitional connection to the exhibition space move the visitor along to the 25,000 sf exhibition space.

Computers pervade our world today. MH/A feels lucky to have made its mark
on that world.

RIO 2016 Olympic stadium competition Winner AECOM!








AECOM has just been announced as the winning firm for the international competition held for the master plan design of Rio 2016 Olympic Park. The first international architecture competition held in the country, the English firm is quite experienced in master plan’s for the Olympics as they were responsible for London’s 2012 Olympic Park Master Plan. The jury chose the winning project by AECOM with chief architect Bill Hanway and Brazilian project author Daniel Gusmão,  because of its unique concept of operation, separate access for athletes and the audience, logistics for the transport system, the viability of implementation and access for parking. In the legacy that the project will leave to the city, the highlights were environmental preservation and the viability of maintaining and preserving the lagoon.More about the winning project and the competition along with plans following the break.The ceremony at the Maria Lenk Aquatic Park, located within the sports complex that will be the heart of the 2016 Olympic Games, was attended by authorities including the Sports Minister Orlando Silva, the mayor of Rio de Janeiro, Eduardo Paes and President of the IAB-RJ, Sergio Magalhães. The announcement of the three winning projects and the three honorable mentions demonstrated the international character of the contest: a Brazilian, an Australian and a Portuguese firm received the honorable mentions. As for the three winning projects, the third place went to the project signed by Portuguese architect Tomás Fernandes Almeida Salgado; the second, to architect Ron Turner, representing an American firm which was associated with the Brazilian firms CDC (Coutinho, Diegues and Lamb) and MPG (Miguel Pinto Guimarães ); the
winner was the English project.© AECOM“It’s a competition for the General Urban Plan. Soon, as announced by Mayor Eduardo Paes, the equipment that will compose the Park will be determined through specific architectural competitions in the next months,” says Sergio Magalhães, IAB/RJ president. Two scenarios were considered: the Olympic Games mode, which would ensure the best conditions for the performance of the sporting competitions, and the Legacy mode, which would ensure the viability of installing new, sustainable enterprises after the Olympics. The Olympic Park has an area of ​​1,18 million square meters and will host 15 Olympic and 11 Paralympics sports contests. In addition to the existing equipment – such as the Maria Lenk Aquatic Park, the Rio Arena and the Cycle Track -, the project includes the construction of temporary facilities (such as the hockey center, the tennis courts and the sponsors villa), permanent equipment (science and sports laboratory, athletic track, Olympic hall, media center and hotel, residential, commercial and leisure enterprises), and the preservation of the green areas system.© AECOM“The Olympic Park will be an urban development of international standard, which not only promotes the best in design, technology, sports and culture, but also satisfies intrinsic urgent and vital needs to its residents, businesses and the environment. Using our experience, we want to ensure that the investment and energy focused on the Barra neighborhood will promote the greatest possible benefit in the long term, “says Bill Hanway, an American who has been living in London for 14 years. He graduated from Washington University (St. Louis, MO), with a post-graduate degree from the School of Design at Harvard University. . In addition to the operational responsibilities for the global firm AECOM, Bill also provides the design leadership and management of multidisciplinary teams delivering projects in the UK, Continental Europe, the US and the Middle East. His UK work focuses on urban regeneration projects, spending the last five years on developing the London 2012 Olympic and Legacy master plan.© AECOM“Reconciling the needs of staging a global sporting event and of a successful and lasting new urban structure is a challenge that our three Master Plans propose to resolve by overcoming the large and small complexities of the Games, allowing a clear and practical approach for the project implementation. Our proposal is an Olympic park of international standard comprising permanent and temporary structures on which the new network of streets and squares of the future city will be located, “added the winner.Cite:
Minner , Kelly . "AECOM Wins International Competition for Master Plan of Rio 2016 Olympic Park" 22 Aug 2011. ArchDaily. Accessed 04 Sep 2011. <http://www.archdaily.com/162510>





The Rio 2016 Olympic and Para-Olympic games, together with other large events scheduled for upcoming years, such as the 2014 World Cup and the 2011 Military Games, generate enormous opportunities for the development of Rio de Janeiro. The Rio 2016 Olympic and Para-Olympic Games represent a celebration of sports and will be a source of transformation for the city, promoting an environmental, architectural, cultural and sustainable economy legacy, benefiting the urban environment and the quality of life of citizens.The Rio 2016 Olympic Park is located in one of the four Olympic centers scheduled for development of the 2016 Games, and concentrates the greatest number of sporting equipment and installations. It is a fundamental space for the development of the Olympic Games and for the vitality of Rio de Janeiro. During the Games, this center will concentrate the main sporting events and offer large meeting spaces for the public, sponsors and athletes. Built in Barra da Tijuca, the Olympic Park will be centrally located in relation to the other sporting arenas in Deodoro, Maracanã and Copacabana. It will also be the largest new development built exclusively for the Games.The International Competition aims to reach a wide range of professionals and seeks creative solutions that unite quality, functionality, and sustainability, which should be joined by use, social, cultural and environmental values. The Competition should favor wide-ranging contributions and establish an integrated approach that ensures that the Project’s requirements are incorporated into the planning, development, and delivery of the Olympic Park installations, from concept to construction of all of its elements. It is expected that the Competition result in a high-quality Olympic Park not only for the sporting events, but also for the region and for the city, as expressions of contemporary culture.For more information, and to download all the necessary documents, please refer to the competition’s official website.
