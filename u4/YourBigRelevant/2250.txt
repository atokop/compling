Gadhafi's Ukrainian nurse talks about life with 'Daddy'





CNN.com"I don't know how he made the choice; perhaps he was a good psychologist," she said. She learned later that he understood people from that first handshake, from that first gaze into their eyes.Soon, she was on her way to Tripoli. Her job was solely to treat Gadhafi and his large family. The rules were strict. The attractive Ukrainian nurses wore no flashy makeup or revealing clothes. "Our appearance was very humble so as to not attract anybody's attention," she said. "We would never put on lipstick going to his house and have vivid colors in our clothes."She was always surrounded by others -- Gadhafi's wife, children, grandchildren, officials within his inner circle. "None of us had ever been one on one with him," she said. "There wasn't even a single room in his household where we could have possibly been left alone with him."That's why she was shocked by the gossip that Gadhafi had sexual relationships with his foreign nurses.

California marijuana street fair fuels debate over legalization





CSMonitor.comFirst came California’s Prop. 215, the 1996 ballot initiative that legalized personal use of medical marijuana for those who had doctor’s prescriptions. That was followed by the proliferation of dispensaries which, she says, legitimized people who were only thinly-veiled drug dealers and who sold drugs too close to schools, playgrounds, and churches.Oakland’s Oaksterdam University opened in November 2007 to offer training for the cannabis industry with a stated mission to “legitimize the business and work to change the law to make cannabis legal.” It has graduated over 8,000 students. Campuses have since opened in Los Angeles, Sebastopol, and Michigan.Since expo organizers are selling the $20 tickets to adults only and limiting entry points, they expect only about 20,000 people to attend. But Baldwin says the speakers, vendors, booths – and pot smell – will be in everybody’s face.

Timothy Ferriss, Silicon Valley’s Self-Help Guru





The New Yorker Every generation gets the self-help guru that it deserves. In 1937, at the height of the Depression, Napoleon Hill wrote “Think and Grow Rich,” which claimed to distill the principles that had made Andrew Carnegie so wealthy. “The Power of Positive Thinking,” by Norman Vincent Peale, which was published in 1952, advised readers that techniques such as “a mind-emptying at least twice a day” would lead to success. By the seventies, Werner Erhard and est promised material wealth through spiritual enlightenment. The eighties and nineties saw management-consultancy maxims married with New Age thinking, with books such as Stephen Covey’s “The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People.” In the past decade or so, there has been a rise in books such as “Who Moved My Cheese?,” by Spencer Johnson, which promise to help readers maximize their professional potential in an era of unpredictable workplaces.

Banks Not Granting Credit To Credit Card Consumers





Moneyland | TIME.com That may sound good. But if you want the recovery to pick up, it’s actually the opposite. Less spending, even on credit, equals less growth and fewer jobs. What’s more, the Fed notes that banks are doing little to turn around the decline in credit card use. According to the Federal Reserve, less than 11 percent of U.S. banks surveyed report that they have eased credit card lending standards.

CANCER : WHERE SURVIVOR IS THE WINNER





CPSINGH_article_FINAL_23Jun.doc As I walked out of his office, the world looked different. Driving back home, the echo of ‘I have cancer’ got louder and louder. All other problems of life like career, achievements, children education, parent’s health, wife’s shopping and boss’s mood, which were major concerns till an hour ago, now appeared too mundane and of little consequence. The new problem had dwarfed them all. 
As I arrived home, I hurriedly went over the lunch, half listening to the mundane chores and squabbles of children and retired to our bed room. Here I disclosed the traumatic news to my wife. A lady of steel and grit, she did not display her emotions. She listened to all the details and then said, “If the doctor says he will cure it, why worry?” I know behind this simple statement was a storm brewing in her mind. The uneasy poise and her body language said all that she didn’t want to say verbally. Till late in the evening, an uneasy calm prevailed between both of us and rest of the world around us. Probably, both were asking same question “Why me?” Even after leading such a pious and regimented healthy life this has to happen to me? Till dinner, things stabilised.

Is youth's 'creeping passivity' happening by design?





The Japan Times Online In an article titled "Youth Subdued: 8 ways young Americans have been dominated," Levine reported online July 28 on Counterpunch (www.counterpunch.org) that passivity is sweeping America's youth — because ruling elites "have created societal institutions that have subdued young Americans and broken their spirit of resistance to domination."....
Of course, America and Japan do not face the same concerns regarding their young people, or their governments and corporations, but their claims to being democratic nations are similar enough.
And if we aspire to true democracy, the citizens of both nations must embrace transparency and accountability, as well as protest and defiance, as essential cornerstones of a just and fair society. If we fail in this today, it is inevitable that we will find ourselves the pawns of the wealthier and more powerful tomorrow.

Mask maker keeping Shimane tradition alive





The Japan Times Online Davies' fascination with kagura in general and the Iwami masks in particular began eight years ago when he and his Japanese wife, Yoko, both tired of city life in Kyoto, decided to take part in the "U-turn/I-turn" program, a government-backed project aimed at luring urbanites into depopulated rural areas.
Having bought a deserted farmhouse and land to cultivate, the couple started out on a course of self-sufficiency, the skills for which Davies had gleaned in the '90s while working as a sheep herder on an Indian reservation in Arizona, where he also met his wife, a sun dancer-turned-garment designer.
Intrigued by the local history and culture, Davies began roaming the area collecting myths and stories from local shrines. It was during this time that he happened upon an exhibition of kagura masks and immediately sought out someone to teach him how to make them.

Couple arrested on charges of extorting Italian premier Berlusconi





Deutsche Welle Tarantini has admitted to paying high-end hooker Patrizia D'Addario and other women to attend Berlusconi's parties, though maintains the prime minister was unaware they were prostitutes. Berlusconi has admitted to making the payments to the Tarantini's, but said he was helping a family in need and had asked nothing in return.
D'Addario, for her part, has said she slept with Berlusconi at his Rome residence and tape recorded the encounter. The conservative leader has maintained he never paid for sex, but has never apologized for his lifestyle.
A warrant has also been issued for the arrest of another man with whom Berlusconi allegedly conducted a controversial phone call. Prosecution transcripts of the call appear to show Berlusconi using repeated profanities and saying he intended to leave Italy, lamenting that the country made him sick.
