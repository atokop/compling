www.realestateradiousa.com | New Zealand Earthquake In Christchurch Christchurch's 400000 residents were warned to stay inside their homes as a major earthquake rattled the town. The earthquake measured 7.1 and the danger of continued aftershocks continue. In an effort to keep the peace and ensure public safety, the authorities have instituted a curfew. Police said the curfew was intended to protect the city's 400000 people from falling debris, as the quake caused widespread damage to buildings, although there were few injuries reported. Mayor Bob Parker declared a state of emergency four hours after the quake struck the east coast of the island region at 4.35am, warning that continuing aftershocks could cause masonry to fall from damaged buildings. "We're all feeling scared, we've just had some significant aftershocks," he told TV One News. "Tonight we're just people in the face of a massive natural disaster, trying to help each other ... and we're grateful we haven't lost a life." There were reports of some people trapped inside damaged buildings, although none appeared to be seriously injured. Police Inspector Alf Stewart told New Zealand's National Radio that some people had been arrested for looting. "We have some reports of people smashing [shop] windows and trying to grab some property that is not theirs ... we've got police on the streets and we're dealing with that," he said. Up to 90 extra police officers are flying to Christchurch to help, and troops are likely <b>...</b>

Wellington, New Zealand - A strong 6.3-magnitude earthquake rocked the southern New Zealand city of Christchurch on Tuesday, seriously injuring people and damaging buildings throughout the city. Live video footage showed parts of buildings collapsed into the streets, which were strewn with bricks and shattered concrete. Sidewalks and roads were cracked and split, and hundreds of dazed, screaming and crying residents wandered through the streets as sirens blared throughout the city. Christchurch Mayor Bob Parker said he was on the top floor of the city council building when the quake hit, throwing him across the room. "I got down onto the street and there were scenes of great confusion, a lot of very upset people," he said. "I know of people in our building who are injured and I've had some reports of serious injuries throughout the city." Radio New Zealand reported that a church near the city center collapsed. The station also said staffers in its Christchurch newsroom had to cling to their desks during the shaking, with large filing cabinets toppling over. Some cars apparently parked on the street were buried under rubble. "What I can see from where I am in the central city is that there are significant amounts of additional damage," Parker said. The US Geological Survey said the temblor was centered 3 miles (5 kilometers) from the city at a depth of 2.5 miles (4 kilometers).

A massive magnitude 8.8 earthquake rocked Chile early Saturday, killing at least 78 people and triggering tsunami warnings for the entire Pacific basin. Chilean President Michelle Bachelet said she expected the death toll to rise. Numerous aftershocks -- including one of magnitude 6.9 -- were felt within hours of the initial quake, the US Geological Survey said. The quake's epicenter was located off the coast of Maule, about 200 miles southwest of the capital of Santiago. It struck at 3:34 am (1:34 am ET), when most people were sleeping. Jolted out of bed "This is a major event. This happened near some very populated areas," said Randy Baldwin, a geophysicist with USGS. "With an 8.8 you expect damage to the population in the area."

READ THE DESCRIPTION!! this video is a tribute for JAPAN GOD BLESS JAPAN !!!!! 11.03.2011 (CNN) -- The powerful earthquake that unleashed a devastating tsunami Friday appears to have moved the main island of Japan by 8 feet (2.4 meters) and shifted the Earth on its axis. "At this point, we know that one GPS station moved (8 feet), and we have seen a map from GSI (Geospatial Information Authority) in Japan showing the pattern of shift over a large area is consistent with about that much shift of the land mass," said Kenneth Hudnut, a geophysicist with the US Geological Survey (USGS). Reports from the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology in Italy estimated the 8.9-magnitude quake shifted the planet on its axis by nearly 4 inches (10 centimeters). The temblor, which struck Friday afternoon near the east coast of Japan, killed hundreds of people, caused the formation of 30-foot walls of water that swept across rice fields, engulfed entire towns, dragged houses onto highways, and tossed cars and boats like toys. Some waves reached six miles (10 kilometers) inland in Miyagi Prefecture on Japan's east coast. The quake was the most powerful to hit the island nation in recorded history and the tsunami it unleashed traveled across the Pacific Ocean, triggering tsunami warnings and alerts for 50 countries and territories as far away as the western coasts of Canada, the US and Chile. The quake triggered more than 160 aftershocks in the first 24 hours -- 141 measuring 5.0 <b>...</b>

SYDNEY, Australia — Rescue workers spent a cold, rainy night searching through rubble for survivors of a powerful earthquake that struck New Zealand's second-largest city, Christchurch, on Tuesday, killing at least 65 people Photographs and video from Christchurch, a graceful 19th-century city of nearly 400000 residents, showed people running through the streets, landslides pouring rocks and debris into suburban streets and extensive damage to buildings. Witnesses told of watching the spire of the iconic Christchurch Cathedral come crashing down during an aftershock. One witness called it "the most frightening thing of my entire life," and television video showed a person clinging to a window in the cathedral's steeple. Officials warned that the death toll was likely to rise as scores of people were still missing and feared trapped in the wreckage of several buildings that were flattened by the 6.3 magnitude earthquake or the aftershocks still rocking the city. "I think we need to prepare ourselves in this city for a death toll that could be significant," Mayor Bob Parker told reporters shortly after declaring a state of emergency and ordering the evacuation of the city center. "It's not going to be good news, and we need to steel ourselves to understand that." Hundreds of frightened residents crammed into temporary shelters.

Earth quake at 4:35am on Friday morning, September the 4th 2010. The New Zealand Army has been called in to help the Christchurch Police close most of the central city area. It was a 7.1 magnitude earthquake. A bit higher at 7.7 or 8.1 would have been a real terrible disaster. Now I read that this area of New Zealand gets a really devastating earthquake about every 300 years. And this area of the South Island of New Zealand is due for that big earthquake right about now. And that earthquake we just had two days ago was not the big expected one! It's a different fault line.
