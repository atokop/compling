Michele Kearney's Environmental Blog - 

Environmental degradation  and waning natural resources including energy resources threaten U.S. security. And the loss of renewable natural resources, including forests, fresh water, fish and fertile soils, can drive political instability and conflict in the developing world, and around the globe. In short, natural resoures, energy and the environment are national security issues.

A Storm of Anxiety Over Fresh Oil Batters the Gulf





A Storm of Anxiety Over Fresh Oil Batters the Gulffrom The Energy Collective - The world's best thinkers on energy & climate by RockyKistnerIn  the Gulf, another maelstrom has hit. But the tropical storm Mother  Nature has brewed  is not the top concern on some resident’s minds.

Statement by EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson on the Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards






EPA Press Office (News Media Only)   press@epa.gov 
202-564-4355 

FOR IMMEDIATE RELASE 
September 2, 2011   

 Statement by EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson on the Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards 

Since day one, under President Obama’s leadership, EPA has worked  to ensure health protections for the American people, and has made  tremendous progress to ensure that Clean Air Act standards protect all  Americans by reducing our exposures to harmful air pollution like  mercury, arsenic and carbon dioxide.  This Administration  has put in place some of the most important standards and safeguards for  clean air in U.S. history: the most  significant reduction of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide air  pollution across state borders; a long-overdue proposal to finally cut  mercury pollution from power plants; and the first-ever carbon pollution  standards for cars and trucks.  We will revisit the ozone standard, in compliance with the Clean Air Act.

Statement by the President on the Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards





THE WHITE HOUSE   
Office of the Press Secretary FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   
September 2, 2011   Statement by the President on the Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards   
Over the last two and half years, my administration, under the  leadership of EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson, has taken some of the  strongest actions since the enactment of the Clean Air Act four decades  ago to protect our environment and the health of our families from air  pollution. From reducing mercury and other toxic air pollution from  outdated power plants to doubling the fuel efficiency of our cars and  trucks, the historic steps we’ve taken will save tens of thousands of  lives each year, remove over a billion tons of pollution from our air,  and produce hundreds of billions of dollars in benefits for the American  people.   
At the same time, I have continued to underscore the importance of  reducing regulatory burdens and regulatory uncertainty, particularly as  our economy continues to recover.  With that in mind, and  after careful consideration, I have requested that Administrator Jackson  withdraw the draft Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards at this  time. Work is already underway to update a 2006 review of the science  that will result in the  reconsideration of the ozone standard in 2013.  Ultimately,  I did not support asking state and local governments to begin  implementing a new standard that will soon be reconsidered.   
I want to be clear: my commitment and the commitment of my  administration to protecting public health and the environment is  unwavering. I will continue to stand with the hardworking men and women  at the EPA as they strive every day to hold polluters accountable and  protect our families from harmful pollution.  And my administration will continue to vigorously oppose efforts to weaken EPA’s authority under the Clean Air Act or dismantle  the progress we have made.

U.S. Government and Biofuels: Too Much Too Soon





U.S. Government and Biofuels: Too Much Too Soonfrom OilPrice.com Daily News Update by summersd@oilprice.com (Dave Summers)It  would seem, despite the inability of the cellulosic ethanol industry to  produce an economically viable product to date, that it remains this  Administration’s answer to coming liquid fuel shortages. Last week President Obama announced that $510 million from the Government, would be invested in biofuels, with an equal amount of private funding.
The U.S. Departments of Agriculture, Energy and Navy will invest  up to $510 million during the next three years, in partnership with the  private sector, to produce advanced drop-in aviation and marine biofuels  for military and commercial transportation, President Barack Obama  announced today.

So Much for the Polar Bears - Arctic Drilling to Begin





So Much for the Polar Bears - Arctic Drilling to Beginfrom OilPrice.com Daily News Update by admin@namecake.com (John Daly)The “good” news for wildlife around the Arctic Circle is that BP, renowned despoiler of the Gulf of Mexico, will not be coming.

BP’s  2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill (also referred as the Macondo  blowout), which surged for three months, has won a place in the Guinness  book of records as the largest accidental marine oil spill in the  history of the petroleum industry.

The bad news is that U.S. oil  international Exxon Mobil has sealed an Arctic oil exploration deal  with Russia’s state-owned oil firm Rosneft, following an agreement  signed on 29 August in the presence of

American Elements Says That U.S. Needs a Strategic Metals Reserve





American Elements Says That U.S. Needs a Strategic Metals Reservefrom OilPrice.com Daily News Update by kennedyc@oilprice.com (Charles Kennedy)American  Elements president and chairman of the board Michael Silver is  advocating that the Obama administration establish a U.S. Strategic  Metals Reserve.

As Silver envisages the repository, it would be  modeled on the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which began the year  after the 1973-74 oil embargo, when OPEC member states’ anger over U.S.  support for Israel during its 1973 war led to an embargo of oil  shipments to the U.S., temporarily tripling oil prices.

Silver said, "The cost of these key strategic metals has increased 25+ fold in the last year.

Why Haven't Gas Prices Fallen More?





Why Haven't Gas Prices Fallen More?from The Energy Collective - The world's best thinkers on energy & climate by Geoffrey StylesWith  the US economy stuck in the doldrums, weakening the demand for oil and  its products, and with the fall of at least portions of Tripoli  foreshadowing the eventual return of Libyan oil exports to the market,  it must seem puzzling that US gasoline prices haven't dropped farther in  the last few weeks.

Low Carbon Strategies and Economic Growthfrom OilPrice.com Daily News Update by tol@oilprice.com (The Oil Drum)At  the intersection of global energy depletion and concerns about human  impact on the environment lie some serious and oft overlooked issues.  Largely gone from our public discourse is the idea that oil is infinite.  It is now accepted, even to previous staunch cornucopians, that  increasing, or even maintaining oil production will come only at higher  costs. The new response to the energy/environmental crisis is to  transition to a green economy, replacing our declining stocks of fossil  sunlight with new technologies able to harness our current sunlight in  its various forms. That these renewable technologies are available,  viable and becoming

Brazil’s Rapidly Expanding Offshore Oil Industry





Brazil’s Rapidly Expanding Offshore Oil Industryfrom OilPrice.com Daily News Update by thyu@oilprice.com (Al Fin)While  the US Obama administration carries on a de facto offshore oil  moratorium, Brazil is rushing to develop its own vast offshore petroleum  resources. Brazil is spending over $220 billion in an attempt to almost  triple its offshore production from over 2 million bpd to over 6  million bpd in 2020. Brazil's oil industry faces tremendous challenges,  working far offshore and deep under the surface.
...the technical and logistical challenges involved in tapping  this oil are immense – the oil is under a layer of salt as far below the  waves as commercial jetliners cruise above them. As a result,  Petrobras, Read more...

90-Day Shale Fracking Report







Secretary of Energy Advisory Board, Shale Gas Subcommittee of the Secretary of Energy Advisory Board 

wikipediaThe Shale Gas Subcommittee of the Secretary of Energy Advisory Board is charged with
identifying measures that can be taken to reduce the environmental impact and improve
the safety of shale gas production.Natural gas is a cornerstone of the U.S. economy, providing a quarter of the country’s
total energy. Owing to breakthroughs in technology, production from shale formations
has gone from a negligible amount just a few years ago to being almost 30 percent of
total U.S. natural gas production. This has brought lower prices, domestic jobs, and the
prospect of enhanced national security due to the potential of substantial production
growth. But the growth has also brought questions about... Read Full Article

Biofuels and carbon management





Biofuels and carbon management  	Abstract  Public  policy supports biofuels for their benefits to agricultural economies,  energy security and the environment. The environmental             rationale is premised on greenhouse gas (GHG, “carbon”)  emissions reduction, which is a matter of contention. This issue is             challenging to resolve because of critical but  difficult-to-verify assumptions in lifecycle analysis (LCA), limits of  available             data and disputes about system boundaries. Although LCA has  been the presumptive basis of climate policy for fuels, careful             consideration indicates that it is inappropriate for  defining regulations. This paper proposes a method using annual basis             carbon (ABC) accounting to track the stocks and flows of  carbon and other relevant GHGs throughout fuel supply chains. Such             an approach makes fuel and feedstock production facilities  the focus of accounting while treating the CO2 emissions from  fuel end-use at face value regardless of the origin of the fuel carbon  (bio- or fossil). Integrated into cap-and-trade             policy and including provisions for mitigating indirect  land-use change impacts, also evaluated on an annual basis, an ABC             approach would provide a sound carbon management framework  for the transportation fuels sector.
