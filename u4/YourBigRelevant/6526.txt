Defunct Colonial Bank Sues The Sh*t Out of Its Former Auditors, Including PwC



A-ha! I hate to say I told you so (no I don't) but, uh, I told you so.

In August of 2009, I caught PwC digging around on my site to find out more about the Colonial Bank failure, a failure which PwC itself oversaw and maybe just participated in (if indirectly, naturally). The year before Colonial's epic failure, PwC auditors gave the bank the all clear. 

"In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The Colonial BancGroup, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2008 and 2007 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America," read the opinion.

Anyway, fast-forward two years and here we are:

Colonial Bancgroup Inc (CBCDQ.PK) and its trustee filed a lawsuit against former auditors PricewaterhouseCoopers LLC and Crowe Horwath LLP, charging them with accounting malpractice and professional negligence for not catching a fraud that led to the bank's collapse.

The complaint was filed late on Wednesday in a Circuit Court in Montgomery County, Alabama.

It also accuses the auditors of breach of contract, saying that PwC's independent audits of its financial statements violated generally accepted accounting standards and served to conceal the seven-year fraud that drained it of $1.8 billion and left it with hundreds of millions of dollars in worthless or nonexistent assets on its balance sheet.
Can someone please tell me why the fuck the PCAOB still has a job with this nonsense going on? Why the fuck does PwC make $13 billion a year soaking its clients on audit fees? And why aren't the people of the United States suing the shit out of these auditors too? Colonial was the 6th largest bank failure in U.S. history and cost taxpayers $3.8 billion.

Anyone else find it funny how they call the audit service arm "Assurance?" It has nothing to do with discovering fraud or giving investors actual peace of mind that the statements they are looking at are, in fact, prepared in accordance with GAAP. Rather it is a mafia-style pay-to-play protection ring that offers clean audit opinions in exchange for cash.

Vomit. All over Dennis Nally's impeccably polished shoes.

TLP: Dick Cheney's Dream Job


 OK, maybe it was more of a coma than a dream, but still.
 Slate:
I haven't yet read In My Time -- hey, I'm still slogging through Mondale's autobiography -- but I trust Charlie Savage when he says Dick Cheney's memoir ends with scenes like this.
 [I]n the epilogue, Mr. Cheney writes that after undergoing heart surgery in 2010, he was unconscious for weeks. During that period, he wrote, he had a prolonged, vivid dream that he was living in an Italian villa, pacing the stone paths to get coffee and newspapers.This is a guy who made gazillions in the oil bidness, picked himself for vice president and had his own secure undisclosed location. Pretty excellent. And when they were trying to keep his evil heart from killing him, all he wanted to be was a lazy paperboy.
 Sorry. That position is filled.

Jr Deputy Accountant's Handy Hurricane Survival Guide


The JDA Hurricane Survival Kit is ready!

I have to admit, I have no fucking clue what to do in a hurricane. I grew up in the Midwest so, you know, tornadoes are more my thing and in the case of a bad twister, you just run your ass into the basement to wait it out. And since I've lived in California my entire adult life, the worst I had to deal with was constant rain 6 months out of the year every year and a few earthquakes.

Now that I've been in DC for almost a year, I'm getting used to dealing with all sorts of ungodly weather events such as 90% humidity (tip: Garnier makes a bad ass product called Anti-Humidity Milk for angry hair), blizzards and thunderstorms. But a hurricane? Christ almighty, this was not in the brochure.

Anyway, here are a few tips based on my experience last winter with no power for three days (thanks, Pepco!).

1. Take a shower. Early. You better get your dirty ass in the shower and make it long and hard (the shower, I mean, not yourself, sicko). And don't forget to shave! Know how your mom always told you to wear clean underwear in case you get in a car accident? The same rule applies here. Trust me, you don't want to end up the hairy bushman waiting in the dark for the power to come back on, trying to shave your wild nether regions by candlelight with a bottle of water and some pump soap.

2. Clean your house. There is nothing more rank than 4 days worth of dirty dishes sitting in a sink because you don't have hot water to wash them with. I made this mistake last winter and finally had to give in and wash them in cold ass water in my cold ass house. So while you're glued to The Weather Channel, just take a moment to clean up, throw in some laundry, vacuum, whatever. Trust me, you'll appreciate a clean house when the shit hits the fan. Or your windows.

3. Remember, alcohol dehydrates you, so if your disaster plan includes booze, compensate with extra water. If you're anything like me, your disaster kit includes lots and lots of alcohol. Make sure to store extra water so you can replenish after that awesome, late night hurricane bender. And here's a tip: store a bottle of vodka in the freezer so you don't have to drink warm vodka lemonades using Gatorade stored in your cabinets. You're welcome.

4. Have extra batteries! Listen, if the power goes out, you're going to get really, really bored. You can only watch trees blowing around outside for so long before you get stir crazy. So make sure you have extra batteries on hand... for the flashlight, for the iPod dock and, most importantly, for any battery-operated adult novelty toys you may have stashed away in your nightstand. Listen, I said it is going to be boring, don't get stuck having to rub one out manually in a disaster.

5. Make sure you have enough prescription medicine if you need it. This is especially true if you are in a medical marijuana state and have a card. Seriously. You can never have too much.

Stay safe out there this weekend, kids. As long as I have BlackBerry juice, I'm sure I'll be live-tweeting updates from the DC hood.

Wall Street Got About As Much Free Money From Bernanke As America Currently Owes On Its Houses




No shit. This is from Bloomberg:

Citigroup Inc. (C) and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) were the reigning champions of finance in 2006 as home prices peaked, leading the 10 biggest U.S. banks and brokerage firms to their best year ever with $104 billion of profits.

By 2008, the housing market’s collapse forced those companies to take more than six times as much, $669 billion, in emergency loans from the U.S. Federal Reserve. The loans dwarfed the $160 billion in public bailouts the top 10 got from the U.S. Treasury, yet until now the full amounts have remained secret.

Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke’s unprecedented effort to keep the economy from plunging into depression included lending banks and other companies as much as $1.2 trillion of public money, about the same amount U.S. homeowners currently owe on 6.5 million delinquent and foreclosed mortgages. The largest borrower, Morgan Stanley (MS), got as much as $107.3 billion, while Citigroup took $99.5 billion and Bank of America $91.4 billion, according to a Bloomberg News compilation of data obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests, months of litigation and an act of Congress.
Remember, these are the loans the Fed did not want America to know it made. Just sayin.

TLP: Jon Huntsman Just Gave Up


 No real votes have been cast yet for any 2012 candidates. (Sorry, Iowa. Hope you enjoyed the funnel cake.) But already, the presidential campaign is over for Jon Huntsman. Wait, who?
 AP and HuffPost:
Republican presidential hopeful Jon Huntsman says he'd be open to running as vice president if rival and tea party favorite Michele Bachmann wins the nomination.
 The former ambassador to China and ex-Utah governor says that every time he's been asked to serve his country he's answered "yes." Huntsman tells CNN interviewer Piers Morgan that if asked by the Minnesota congresswoman to run as her vice president he'd "be the first person to sign up, absolutely."
 Huntsman tried quickly to backtrack, saying the answer was based on a hypothetical question and that he has no doubt he'll win the GOP nomination. The interview was aired Monday night.Not only was it a hypothetical question, apparently Huntsman felt the actual interview was make-believe. "This is a hypothetical conversation," he said, realizing he was doomed. "We're going to win. And I have no doubt about that."
 Mmmhmm.

Was There a Bomb Involved in 9/11 I Didn't Know About?





CNN had an article yesterday about PTSD and how it affected East Coasters traumatized by 9/11 who survived yesterday's 5.9 earthquake in Virginia and beyond. I was in San Francisco on 9/11/01 so I can't really say that I was traumatized in the same way, but it was interesting to hear how others took the loud, frightening rumble that came moments before the walls started rattling. Oddly, I tweeted afterward that I thought a plane had crashed outside. Being so close to the center of government, I imagined I'd find some mangled government helicopter half-inserted into the pavement and spewing flames everywhere.

Maybe I don't have my 9/11 facts down right but to what bomb could this person be referring? I know it was 10 years ago and my mind isn't what it once was at a ripe old 20 but I don't recall there being any bomb. Unless you're a 9/11 conspiracy theorist and believe, like many do, that much of what we saw that day was a controlled demolition.

Anyway. CNN:

People who lived through the attacks of September 11, 2001, in New York and Washington most likely have a low level of fear and anxiety that generally stays in the back of their psychological experience, but can be triggered, said Nadine Kaslow, professor of psychiatry at Emory University School of Medicine.

For some, a sudden traumatic event such as Tuesday’s earthquake can be a trigger of symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, although usually not the full-blown condition. They may feel panic, anxiety and fear, and even upsetting memories of past trauma.

“I guess I was frightened.  I’m not a scaredy-cat or anything. I didn’t think of an earthquake. I really thought something happened again,” Rea said.

Rea darted out of her chair and looked across the street to the police academy to see the reaction there. When she saw no activity, she calmed down.

She tweeted later: “For the people laughing at ny'ers b/c it was a small quake – you weren't here for 9/11 and didn't know if this was another bomb.”
Again, another bomb?

What was that we said about "never forget?" Or was that just a careless slip that the 9/11 Commission wished hadn't been made?

Much to Ben Bernanke's Chagrin, JDA Survived the Great DC Earthquake


Just in case you're worried, I'm happy to report that kitties and I survived the great DC earthquake of 2011. I was at work when it hit and very nearly pissed myself. As many of you know, I spent over ten years in San Francisco so I'm no stranger to earth-shaking events but I have to say I never experienced anything like that in my life - I thought a plane crashed into my office and went running outside like an idiot. Hint: don't do that.

Here are some pics of the damage at my condo for your viewing pleasure!

 Oh God! My poor Zumba fitness game!!
In fairness to the DC quake, this vase could have been tipped over by one of the cats. No, fuck that, it most likely was tipped over by one of my fucking cats. The young one. That inconsiderate bastard.
Why the fuck is this painting on the floor?!
Noooooo! Not my jam box remote!!!
Stay safe out there, kids, the aftershocks are coming.

This Might Be Depressing: Ron Paul In a Dead Heat With Obama Says Gallup Poll




I'm not sure how to take this news.

From Ron Paul 2012:

Many people believe that such a thorough constitutionalist is far too pure to ever become president. Gallup says they’re wrong:

“President Barack Obama is closely matched against each of four possible Republican opponents when registered voters are asked whom they would support if the 2012 presidential election were held today. Mitt Romney leads Obama by two percentage points, 48% to 46%, Rick Perry and Obama are tied at 47%, and Obama edges out Ron Paul and Michele Bachmann by two and four points, respectively.”

Among registered voters, Paul receives 45% to Obama’s 47%. Among national adults, Paul gets 44% to Obama’s 45%. These numbers essentially show statistical dead heats between President Obama and Paul, and the same is true of the other Republican candidates mentioned.
Don't get incensed if the media doesn't give half a rat's ass about Ron Paul, you're foolish if you believe their official duty is to report reality. 

Watch this video of Candy Crowley going in for the kill to see what I mean (email subscribers can watch on YouTube here):

TLP: Ron Paul Supporter Has Sexy Thoughts About Rick Perry


 Here's one way for Ron Paul's supporters to get more media attention for his presidential campaign. You know, the campaign that they complain reporters are ignoring. Maybe you've heard about it.
 The Huffington Post:
A full-page ad paid for by a supporter of Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul in the Austin Chronicle asks, "Have you ever had sex with Rick Perry?"
 The eyebrow-raising message comes less than one week after the Texas governor announced his candidacy for president of the United States. Justin Elliot at Salon calls attention to the ad in the newsweekly and notes that there is no evidence that Perry has engaged in an extramarital affair.
 Text in the ad reads, "Are you a stripper, an escort, or just a 'young hottie' impressed by an arrogant, entitled governor of Texas? Contact CASH [Committee Against Sexual Hypocrisy], and we will help you publicize your direct dealings with a Christian-buzzwords-spouting, 'family values' hypocrite and fraud."Gets attention, that's for sure. As does the gay innuendo, none of which is new for Perry to have to deal with.
 Maybe it wasn't so smart for Perry to start his campaign with "ugly" talk about Ben Bernanke. If there's anything that Ron Paul can count on getting attention for, it's riding that pony.

The DoJ Goes After S&P, Not At All Coincidentally





But don't you dare call it retaliation. More like calculated misfeasance:

The Justice Department is investigating whether the nation’s largest credit ratings agency, Standard & Poor’s, improperly rated dozens of mortgage securities in the years leading up to the financial crisis, according to two people interviewed by the government and another briefed on such interviews.

The investigation began before Standard & Poor’s cut the United States’ AAA credit rating this month, but it is likely to add fuel to the political firestorm that has surrounded that action. Lawmakers and some administration officials have since questioned the agency’s secretive process, its credibility and the competence of its analysts, claiming to have found an error in its debt calculations. 
Right. 

The government didn't seem to care much when S&P was giving Grade A Awesome to Grade B Bullshit.

Survey: 75% of Americans Don't Give a F*** What Happens to Mailmen


cat in a mailbox will fuck you up

Rasmussen Reports asked 1,000 Americans how they feel about the Postal Service...if you are a postal worker, you might want to look away.

Personally, I have to say I love my DC hood mailmen and postal workers. One tried to talk me out of getting any more tattoos as I was buying a money order. That's service! 

Anyway, Courier, Express, and Postal Observer has the actual numbers from the survey:


1) How closely have you followed recent stories about the US postal service?

* 28%  Following very closely
* 43%  Following but not very closely
* 29%  Not following [iinferred from press release]

2) The US Postal Service lost about $8 billion last year and wants to lay off about 120,000 workers over the next few years. Congressional approval is required for any such changes. Should the federal government provide subsidies to cover the postal service’s losses or should it allow the postal service to lay off 120,000 postal workers?

* 50% Preferred laying off postal employees
* 33% Preferred subsidies of losses
* 17% Undecided

3) Postal Service employees are covered by a federal employees benefits health insurance and retirement benefits program. The Postal Service wants to withdraw from the federal benefits plan, run its own program, and offer its employees fewer benefits. If it means providing employees with lower benefits, should the Postal Service be allowed to run its own benefits program?

* 56% Supported the USPS running its own benefit plans if it means providing employees with lower benefits
* 27% Opposed having the USPS running its own benefit plans if it means providing employees with lower benefits
* 16% Undecided

4) One way to reduce the Postal Service losses would be to reduce mail delivery in some parts of the country to just three or four days a week. If you had a choice, would you rather see the federal government cover the cost of Postal Service losses or cut back mail services in some parts of the country to three or four days a week?

* 75% Prefer cut back in mail service in some parts of the country to three or four days a week
* 17% Prefer subsidies to maintain services
* 8% undecided
The takeaway I got from this was that America doesn't give a fuck what happens to mailmen. Three to four days of the shit is fine for us, thankyouverymuch.

I don't know about you all but the whole mail thing has gotten tedious. All this bullshit junk mail comes between weird written notices that somehow have to accompany emails that say the same thing. Kill it. So it makes sense that America would be fine with 3 - 4 days a week.

Half of them don't care if postal workers' benefits are cut.

Another half of them would prefer 120,000 postal workers lose their jobs than for Congress to give the USPS money to prevent having to make those cuts. 

That tells you something about where America is at with all that.

TLP: Bono May Have Found What He Was Looking for – on Facebook


 It wasn't that long ago that Bono was being mocked as "the worst investor in America" for the stake Elevation Partners took in Palm. The rap was that Palm was a loser in the smartphone market dominated by iPhone, BlackBerry and Android devices.  Things are better now for Bono the investor and he probably doesn't care what kind of smartphone you use, as long as you "Like" Facebook. Forever.
 Guardian:
U2 frontman Bono's investment firm could be looking at a profit of almost $800m on its stake in Facebook, it has emerged.
 The social networking site has just been valued at an eye-popping $65bn - up from $50bn in January - following the sale of a stake by advertising and marketing giant Interpublic Group.
 Interpublic was an early investor in Facebook and has just sold half of its 0.4% share in the group for $133m (£81m), valuing the site at more than $65bn.
 This values the U2's Elevation Partners' stake at $975m - more than four times the $210m it paid in November 2009. ...
 Facebook is now one of Elevation's stellar investments. When it bought the stock - which is difficult to get hold of - the company was hot but worth a relatively "meagre" $9bn.Turns out too much is not enough.

Rick Perry Would Still Kick Bernanke's Ass




That's a comforting thought:

Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry on Tuesday didn’t run from comments he made in Iowa on Monday about Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, despite criticism from across the political spectrum.

“Look, I’m just passionate about the issue,” the Texas governor told the New York Times on Tuesday, “and we stand by what we said.”
Remember when Bernanke was banned from going to China? My how things change.


I'm surprised we don't treat him ugly here in DC, personally.
