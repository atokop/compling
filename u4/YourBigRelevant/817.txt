A spokesman for Washington National Cathedral says at least three of the four pinnacles on the central tower have fallen off and the central tower appears to be leaning.
The pinnacles are the top stones on the cathedral's towers. Richard Weinberg, director of communications for the cathedral, said the cathedral has been evacuated and stone masons are assessing the damage.
The Washington National Cathedral is an Episcopal Church landmark in the capital. Located in the northwest quadrant of the city near foreign embassies and the vice president's residence, the gothic-like structure is among the tallest in the city. It's historically been the site of funerals and memorials for presidents and statesmen.
UPDATE:
By Lauren Markoe
c. 2011 Religion News Service
WASHINGTON (RNS) The iconic Washington National Cathedral, already struggling with financial problems, faces millions of dollars in repair costs from the damage inflicted by Tuesday's (Aug. 23) East Coast earthquake.

And nothing is covered by insurance, according to a church official.

Clergy and a team of architects and engineers spent the day after the magnitude 5.8 quake assessing the cathedral, and found significant damage, including fallen carved angels on the church's roof, cracks in flying buttresses, and missing finials from the pinnacles of the central tower.

"We run a very tight budget here at the cathedral and we have had our financial challenges that we've worked through very well," the Very Rev. Samuel Lloyd, dean of the cathedral, said Wednesday.

"But there is nothing in our budget that would allow us to step up and do this," he said.

Joe Alonso, the cathedral's head stone mason, said it will take years to complete the repairs.

"It's going to be millions, no doubt about it. Millions," he said. "As large as this structure is, it's all hand made."

Hit hard by the recession, the Episcopal cathedral in recent years has weathered several rounds of staff layoffs and been forced to cut programming.

The charge now, Lloyd said, is to go back to those who contributed to the construction of the cathedral, which began in 1907 and was completed in 1990.

"It was built by people from across the country who believe having this space for the nation in the heart of the nation's capital is a hugely important enterprise," said Lloyd. A new feature on the cathedral's website encourages donations.

The cathedral, the second largest in the nation, will be closed through Saturday as engineers continue to assess the damage. Church officials say they hope it will be open for Sunday services.

Officially, the cathedral is the mother church of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, but bills itself as a "house of prayer for all people."

The earthquake and the subsequent damage "has not been a jarring thing for our faith," Lloyd said. "What it has done is challenge us to claim our faith, to go to work to make this place be as grand as beautiful and powerful as its always been."

				The cathedral is important and steeped in American history.  However, a building is only a building and religion is about faith in action.  It is about serving the Lord and one another. 

I say if the building is dangerous to use - tear it down.  Otherwise, if safe to use as a sanctuary wait for a better economy to do necessary repairs.  In any case it is clearly not the responsibi­ty of the government to assume any costs.

I think you are more interested in having a GRAND AND BEAUTIFUL AND POWERFUL PLACE.  What are you doing to do what is in the Holy Bible than changing it????? Gay marraiges, is not in the Bible, Same Sex is not in the bible..etc­, but you did not see the incident as a WARNING TO TURN FROM ALL THE SINFUL THINGS THAT HAS BEEN GOING ON IN THE NATIONAL CATHEDRAL AND DO WHAT IS RIGHT ACCORDING TO THE "HOLY BIBLE" I presume you may claim to be reading.

				All the posters here saying they hope the church gets repaired, are you sending money?  That is the only way it will be fixed.  The article says it will take "millions.­"  

Now, if you are considerin­g sending money for that, think instead about donating that amount to a charity that actually will help people in need.  Your local food shelf or clothing supplier to the needy would love to have that money so they can help people who have no jobs and no hope.

If you think a building is more important than people, you really have your priorities screwed up.

				No. It is supposed to be the Episcopal Cathedral for the Diocese of Washington­. It serves both as the seat of the Presiding Bishop of The Episcopal Church and the Bishop of Washington­.

Your question is a good one. It gets tricky because Congress has designated the Washington National Cathedral as the "National House of Prayer".

It has been used for a handful of presidenti­al funerals. It was used for a memorial service for victims of Sept 11, 2011. Memorial for victims of the Vietnam war. Monthly services were held during WWII "on behalf of a united people in a time of emergency" which have given it a different role than say your average corner church.

No, it is not the official state church, but has been used for events of wider importance to the country.
