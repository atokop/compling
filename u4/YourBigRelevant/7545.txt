News presenters cannot hide their grief while reporting on the devastating Wenchuan Earthquake, which claimed 70000 lives. "Child, quick, take mom's hand" --An online poem dedicated to all the children who died in the Wenchuan Earthquake Child, quick, take mom's hand The road to heaven is too dark Mom's afraid you'll bump your head Quick, take mom's hand, let mom go with you Mom's afraid the road to heaven is too dark, I can't see your hand Ever since the fallen wall took away the sunlight I can never again see your gentle gaze. Go, child. The road ahead has no sadness You must remember what dad and I look like We'll walk together in the next life Mom, don't worry The road to heaven is crowded There are many classmates and friends We say, don't cry Every mom is our mom Every child is mom's child In the days without me, give your love to the living children Mom, don't cry Tears won't light up our road Let us go by ourselves Mom, I will remember what you and dad look like I will remember our promise We'll walk together in the next life
