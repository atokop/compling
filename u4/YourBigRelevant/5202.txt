A magnitude 5.8 earthquake struck in Virginia on Tuesday afternoon, with tremors felt as far away as New York City, Washington D.C., North Carolina and Ohio, CNN and the USGS report.
The Associated Press reports that the epicenter was in Mineral, Va., northwest of Richmond, and was 3.7 miles deep.
No injuries have have been reported, according to the Associated Press.
WABC-TV reported on its Twitter feed that as a precaution, the control towers at John F. Kennedy International Airport and at Newark Liberty International Airport were evacuated.
According to Reuters, the Port Authority is reporting that as of 3:03 P.M. EST, flights at both airports have resumed.
In a statement, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) asked that people use text messages rather than make phone calls as cellular networks in Washington, D.C. and New York are reportedly congested.
Governor Andrew M. Cuomo said in a statement that the Indian Point nuclear power plant has not been damaged:
The State Office of Emergency Management continues to monitor effects in New York State from the earthquake that originated in Virginia this afternoon.

	Currently, there have been no reports of damage to buildings, bridges, roads, power grids, the Indian Point nuclear power plant, or other infrastructure.
In March, Gov. Cuomo called for Indian Point to be closed after a report from the Union of Concerned Scientists said the plant had engineering vulnerabilities. Indian Point is about 24 miles north of The Bronx.
New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said in a statement that "there are no reports of significant damage or injuries in New York City at this time."
From Mayor Bloomberg's statement:
"Like people up and down the East Coast, New Yorkers across the five boroughs felt the effect of this afternoon’s earthquake in Virginia. I’ve spoken with our Police and Fire Commissioners, and we’ve activated the Office of Emergency Management’s Situation Room and spoken to other city agencies, including the Department of Buildings. Thankfully, there are no reports of significant damage or injuries in New York City at this time. As ever, we urge New Yorkers to call 911 only in cases of actual emergencies."

"Shortly before 2:00 PM, we evacuated City Hall briefly, but quickly returned to work. As we await more news from Virginia and elsewhere, our thoughts in New York are with those who were more directly affected by this natural disaster."
There was a partial chimney collapse at one of the buildings in the Red Hook West Houses, a public housing development in Brooklyn, the mayor said at a press conference on Tuesday afternoon. There were no injuries reported, and the building was deemed safe for re-entry after the city's engineers inspected it.
Mayor Bloomberg also said that the subway did not experience any delays. He also reported a large spike in calls to 311 and 911 directly following the tremor.
Cy Vance, the Manhattan district attorney, was interrupted while he was giving a press conference about the Dominique Strauss Kahn case.
WATCH: Vance press conference interrupted by earthquake:

In February, Won-Young Kim, a seismologist at Columbia University, said that New York City is long overdue for an earthquake.

 USGS Records 2 Aftershocks


The USGS has now recorded two aftershocks measuring 2.8 and 2.2 in magnitude. 


 Earthquake May Have Distracted From Larger Threat Of Hurricane


HuffPost's Lynne Peeples reports:Has today's earthquake distracted East Coasters from a greater pending threat?The National Hurricane Center forecasts Hurricane Irene's winds will peak at about 125 mph over the next few days, as the storm makes its way through the Bahamas and up the eastern seaboard -- potentially as far north as New England.The result could very well be a double or even triple-whammy of natural hazards for some regions. “The flooding may be intensified in areas that have received torrential rainfall recently this month, such as coastal areas of the Northeast,” reported AccuWeather.com.During a press conference on the earthquake, New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg said that he is “more concerned” about the approaching hurricane, according to a tweet from The New York Times’ Michael Paulson.“There is nothing between where Irene is now and the U.S. in keeping it from not intensifying further into a major hurricane,” Chris Hyde, a meteorologist with MDA EarthSat Weather in Gaithersburg, Md., told Bloomberg News. “The water temperatures are warm especially when you get to the Gulf Stream. The Gulf Stream is going to explode this thing.”

 Earthquake Is Not Harbinger Of Things To Come


HuffPost's Tom Zeller reports:Dr. Lynn Sykes, an earthquake expert at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, said that while Tuesday’s 5.8 temblor near Mineral, Va., was a new high for the so-called central Virginia seismic zone, it ought not be thought of as a harbinger of things to come.“We should read this as just another earthquake,” Sykes said. He added, however, that it should serve as something of a “wake-up call.” No one is alive who can recall the 5.2 magnitude earthquake that hit New York City in 1884, Sykes said, but they do happen. And easterners, he said, are complacent in the sense that critical infrastructure  -- including nuclear power plants -- east of the Mississippi are typically not designed to withstand high-magnitude earthquakes. The Indian Point nuclear power plant just north of New York City is designed to withstand a 6.1 magnitude quake, for example.“Back in the 1960s, when the first designs for these plants were put forth, the idea was that this area is not as active as others -- and that’s true,” Sykes said. “But they went ahead and designed reactors for quite a small earthquake.”

 Some Primary Voting In Virginia Moved To Parking Lots


Patch reports that an already low turnout is likely to be even lower for primary voting in Northern Virginia:"We're setting up voting in parking lots in some places," said Edgardo Cortes, registrar, for Fairfax County Office of Elections. Voting in parking lots is either by paper ballot or machines operating on battery power, he noted.More here.

 Maryland Reacts To Quake: 'The Scariest Few Minutes Of My Life'


Patch reports from Columbia, Maryland:Howard County Chamber of Commerce spokeswoman Laura Morena-Hill said the quake started soft, with the floor and her office chair vibrating.“But it quickly picked up intensity and strength to the point the whole building was rocking and shaking back and forth,” she wrote in an e-mail. “It only lasted a few minutes, but those were the scariest few minutes of my life! We all ran out of the building and stood outside until we thought it was safe.”Read the full report here.

				I suppose anyone who lived in California for any length of time is kind of thinking, “Oh Come on! 5.8 Nad up people!” Still it is really scary for first times. So yeah you get a sympathy vote.  I can not believe all the posters trying to make this symbolic of something else.  Yeah it’s an Act of God. But I doubt that it’s God acting.
