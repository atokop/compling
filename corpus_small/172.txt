China Earthquake Leaves 156 Dead


156 are dead--and about 5,500 injured--in China, Saturday, following a 6.6 magnitude earthquake that ravaged the mostly rural and mountainous parts of Sichuan province. This is the most powerful earthquake China has experienced in the past three years, but the region has seen worse. Back in 2008, another major quake killed nearly 70,000 in the near where Saturday's disaster struck. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang has urged rescuers to act quickly, saying "The current most urgent issue is grasping the first 24 hours since the quake's occurrence, the golden time for saving lives."
