2G scam: CVC receives more complaints
2G scam: CVC receives more complaints
 
New Delhi: The CVC has received fresh complaints related to 2G scam in which new names of bureaucrats, both serving and retired, have cropped up and the anti-corruption watchdog has forwarded them to the CBI for further investigation.Highly placed sources said the Central Vigilance Commission has received complaints recently against former Telecom Minister A Raja and certain serving and retired Telecom Ministry officials for alleged violation of Government norms in spectrum allocation during their tenure.They said the complaints were forwarded to the CBI to cross check their authenticity and take necessary action."We have got some complaints related to 2G. They are being sent to the CBI for further investigation," a senior CVC official said requesting anonymity.He said the fresh complaints have objected to the role of certain bureaucrats who were serving in Ministry of Telecommunications then.The officer refused to divulge more information on the content and nature of complaints saying the matter was subjudice.The sources, however, clarified that Commission has filed its report on 2G spectrum to the CBI and is not investigating any matter related to it.The CVC has found gross irregularities and procedural lapses while giving licenses on first-come first-serve to telecom companies who did not comply with eligibility criteria.It has also found instances of criminal conspiracy in distribution of the 2G spectrum in its report."In our report shared with the CBI and other agencies, we have already said that there were procedural irregularities. The CBI is looking into the matter," the official said. (Agencies)
