New Delhi: The 6.8-magnitude earthquake in India's Sikkim state on Sunday evening was the fourth tremor reported in the country in September so far, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).
There have been a total of 15 earthquakes of significance in India and its neighbourhood, as well as all over the world in September this year. The most high-intensity quakes of 7.0 on the Richter scale each were reported from the South Pacific island nations of Vanuatu (September 03) and Fiji (September 15).
The first quake in India was reported in Manipur's Ukhrul district on September 04, and its intensity was 4.2. The second, on September 07, was also of low 4.2 intensity and epicentred in Haryana's Sonepat region. The tremors were felt in Delhi and most of north India.
    The third on September 11 was epicentred in Gujarat's Kutch region, but its intensity was a mere 3.4.

  It has been the scariest day of our lives. when we ran out of our houses, quite a few ladies seemed to just faint and collapse out of shock, a lady was hit on her head by the rubbles of a old building in our neighbourhood.she is in hospital. this building seems to be leaning on the wall of the next building, it is dark so we cant see much, we will know more by tomorrow. too scared to sleep, expecting after shocks. Already felt 1 or 2 of them, expecting more. Has been raining terribly too all day. people are all on the streets packed with necessary things, we too are ready with our shoes on, ready to run.................pray for us all............
