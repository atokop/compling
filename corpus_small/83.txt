LUSHAN, April 21 (Xinhua) -- A devastating earthquake that shook southwest China's Sichuan Province Saturday has killed 181 people and injured more than 10,000 as of midday Sunday.
An additional 24 people are reported missing.
The 7.0-magnitude quake jolted Lushan County of Ya'an, a city near the provincial capital Chengdu, at 8:02 a.m. Saturday Beijing Time.
Rescuers are racing against time to save lives, hoping to take full advantage of the first 72 hours after the quake, a period in which survivors are still likely to be found.
Here are some snapshots from the quake sites.
WOMAN HANDS OUT EGGS
As vehicles carrying rescuers waited in lines at the end of a congested highway leading to Lushan County Sunday morning, a woman tapped their windows to distribute boiled eggs.
Zou Guangqin, 56, is a peasant woman from Yingjing, a county of Ya'an City which was also affected by the quake.
Zou said she became restless when she saw rescue vehicles fully loaded with People's Liberation Army soldiers, armed police officers and firefighters passing her village to other seriously-battered areas. "They remind me of my son, who is also a soldier."
The highway that passes her village in Datianba Township and links to Tianquan County was packed with vehicles, including trucks carrying rescuers and relief supplies, cars carrying reporters and local residents eager to go home to the quake zones.
Traffic was so slow that most of the vehicles were at a standstill for two hours.
"So I went home and boiled all the eggs I had, several hundred in all," Zou said.
Many people helped her distribute eggs and water to the passing vehicles.
