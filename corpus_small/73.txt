Thousands of rescue workers combed through flattened villages in southwest 
  China on Sunday in a race to find survivors from a powerful quake as the 
  toll of dead and missing rose past 200.

The Ministry of Civil Affairs put the number of dead at 179 and missing at 24, 
  with almost 11,500 injured, 960 of them seriously. 
On Saturday night, the Daily Telegraph became the first foreign news 
  organisation to reach the epicentre of the quake, witnessing the devastation 
  at Lushan county, on the outskirts of Ya'an, a city of roughly 1.5 million 
  in Sichuan province. 
Huge slabs of concrete that had sheared off buildings lay by the side of the 
  road, while survivors camped out amid the rubble in blue rescue tents.

The moment the China earthquake hit
20 Apr 2013
"I was very scared, it felt like it was shaking for an hour," said 
  Li Xiaoqin, a ten-year-old girl sitting by the side of a fire with her 
  family in the village of Yuqi. 
Her mother, Li Zhongmin, said the family of ten had fled their wooden house, 
  which had been obliterated by the quake. "The first thing that went 
  through my mind was to run. We got outside as soon as everything started 
  shaking."
The initial quake, at just after 8am, was judged to be 6.6 magnitude by the 
  United States Geological Survey and 7 magnitude by the Chinese authorities. 
There were a further nine aftershocks over the course of the next hour, 
  triggering mud slides in the tall mountains around the epicentre. 
The quake occurred along the same Longmenshan fault line that ruptured during 
  the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, a 7.9 magnitude disaster that claimed some 
  68,000 lives. 
A single road to the disaster zone was blocked off by police yesterday in 
  order to control the flow of traffic in and out of the area. 
Every few hundred feet, huge boulders had rolled down from the mountains above 
  and crashed into the tarmac, while the force of the earthquake had also 
  opened gaping crevasses in the road, hampering the rescue effort. 
The 80 mile journey from Chengdu, the provincial capital, took more than six 
  hours, with frequent halts as soldiers dynamited obstacles on the road. 
The village of Longmen was said by locals to have been the worst hit. Wang 
  Zhenglun, a 60-year-old headmaster, said he was leading a team of volunteers 
  to Longmen. "I have spoken to another teacher there, and they said 99 
  per cent of the houses had collapsed," he said. 
Along the road to the epicentre, hundreds of People's Liberation Army trucks 
  were providing food and aid, while firefighters, black-clad SWAT teams and 
  civilian volunteers were all pouring up the mountain through Gaohe as the 
  hunt for survivors continued. By last night, more than 51 people had 
  reportedly been pulled from the rubble. 
As darkness fell on the mountainous region, those trying to escape the worst 
  hit villages brought with them horrific tales of destruction. "One girl 
  has lost her legs," said Wang Yufang, a 60-year-old construction worker 
  from Qiankou village, not far from the epicentre. 
As the extent of the damage became clear, the Chinese authorities launched a 
  level one emergency rescue plan, and the Chinese prime minister, Li Keqiang, 
  flew first to Chengdu and then onto Lushan by helicopter.

Some 7,000 soldiers were also mobilised to help unblock roads and search the 
  debris while convoys of helicopters ferried the dead and injured out of the 
  more remote areas of the disaster zone. 
"The current most urgent issue is grasping the first 24 hours since the 
  quake's occurrence, the golden time for saving lives," said Mr Li, 
  according to the official Xinhua news agency. 
In another complication, rain started to fall on the region last night and 
  forecasts suggested there would be more rain in the coming days. The China 
  Meteorological Administration warned of possible landslides and other 
  geological disasters. 
The local earthquake administration added that there had been a total of 712 
  aftershocks by last night. 
"It is a mountainous rural area, which was also badly hit by the 2008 
  earthquake, with many houses destroyed and needing to be rebuilt," said 
  a statement from the International Red Cross, which was scrambling to 
  provide assistance. 
"Local authorities say that several key roads are blocked, making it 
  challenging for rescue teams to get to the worst-hit townships within Lushan 
  County, some of which are believed to be very badly damaged," it added.
