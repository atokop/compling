                                                                 –
                                                                A 6.8 earthquake shook northeastern India and Nepal today, killing at least 26 people, injuring scores and damaging buildings and sending lawmakers in Nepal's capital running into the streets, reports the BBC. The quake was felt across northeast India, including the capital of New Delhi. It triggered at least two aftershocks of magnitude 6.1 and 5.3, an Indian seismology official said. He warned that more aftershocks were possible.
                                                            
                                                                The full extent of damage was not immediately known because the region is sparsely populated with many living in remote areas which were cut off by mudslides triggered by the quake, notes  AP . TV stations reported buildings collapsed and sidewalks cracked in Sikkim's state capital of Gangtok, 42 miles (68 kilometers) southeast of the quake's epicenter. The Indo-Tibetan Border Police said two of its buildings had collapsed in Gangtok.
                                                    A USGS map shows the 6.8 earthquake, which hit near Sikkim, India.

                If you are going to breathlessly report every 6.0 - 6.9 earthquake, you will be reporting them over 2 times a week - the average number of 6 earthquakes annually is 134.

12 New Frog Species Found
One sounds like a cat, say scientists in India
                    (AP) - Years of combing tropical mountain forests have paid off for a team of Indian scientists that has discovered 12 new frog species, plus three others thought to have been extinct. The new species include the meowing night frog, whose croak sounds more like a cat's call; the jog night frog, unique in that both the males and females watch over the eggs; and the Wayanad night frog, which grows to about the size of a baseball. Three other species were rediscovered, including the Coorg night frog described 91 years ago but not seen since. More»
