 Rescuers are hunting for survivors after an earthquake strikes rural China, killing more than 150 people and injuring thousands.
A strong 6.6 magnitude earthquake has hit China’s Sichuan province, the epicenter is close to where a major earthquake killed almost 70,000 people in 2008.
The CBC reports the new totals leaving at least 160 people dead and more than 6,700 injured.
Saturday morning’s earthquake triggered landslides and disrupted phone and power connections in mountainous Lushan county. The village of Longmen was hit particularly hard, with authorities saying nearly all the buildings there had been destroyed in a frightening minute-long shaking.
In nearby Ya’an town, where aftershocks could be felt nearly 20 hours after the quake, residents sat in groups outside convenience stores watching the news on television sets.
President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Li Keqiang said that all efforts must be put into rescuing victims to limit the death toll as much as possible.

“The current most urgent issue is grasping the first 24 hours since the quake’s occurrence, the golden time for saving lives,” Xinhua news agency quoted Mr Li as saying.
According to local media reports, a vehicle carrying 17 soldiers fell off a cliff and into a river as it traveled to the epicenter. One soldier was killed and seven more injured, three seriously.
But extraordinary stories of survival are already emerging. According to one local media report, a mother managed to lift concrete weighing 50kg to rescue her son from the rubble.
