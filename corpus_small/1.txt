China earthquake toll rises: Over 160 killed; about 6,700 hurt; several critical
The 6.6 magnitude quake strikes Sichuan province

Residents gather outside their homes after a 6.6 magnitude earthquake which struck near Ya'an city, in Chengdu, Sichuan province, April 20, 2013. About 100 people could have died or been injured in the earthquake on Saturday, close to where a massive temblor struck in 2008, killing almost 70,000. (REUTERS)



The powerful earthquake that rocked China has claimed 165 lives so far and injured more than 6,700, according to state media reports.
The quake that southwest China on Saturday wrecked homes and triggered landslides in an area devastated by a major tremor in 2008.
The shallow earthquake struck Sichuan on the edge of the Tibetan Plateau just after 8:00 am, triggering a major rescue operation in the province where 87,000 people were reported dead or missing five years ago.
Eight hours after the quake hit Lushan county in the city of Ya'an, the death toll stood at 102, CCTV news said, quoting the China Earthquake Administration. At least 10,000 homes were destroyed, the Sichuan government said.
Local seismologists registered the quake at magnitude 7.0 while the US Geological Survey gave it as 6.6. More than 260 aftershocks followed, the People's Daily said on its website.
The shaking was felt in the provincial capital Chengdu, which lies to the east, and even in the megacity of Chongqing several hundred kilometres away.
Panicked residents fled into the streets, some of them still in their slippers and pyjamas, reported AFP.
President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang said all efforts must be put into rescuing victims to limit the death toll. Li was on his way to Ya'an, state media said.
"The current most urgent issue is grasping the first 24 hours since the quake's occurrence, the golden time for saving lives," Xinhua quoted Li as saying.
 
Earlier Reuters reported 6,000 troops were heading to the area to help with rescue efforts. State television CCTV said only emergency vehicles were being allowed into Ya'an, though Chengdu airport had reopened.
 
Most of the deaths were concentrated in Lushan, where water and electricity were cut off. Pictures on Chinese news sites showed toppled buildings and people in bloodied bandages being treated in tents outside the hospital, which appeared only lightly damaged.
 
Rescuers in Lushan had pulled 32 survivors out of rubble, Xinhua said. In villages closest to the epicentre, almost all   low rise houses and buildings had collapsed, according to footage broadcast on state television.
 
"We are very busy right now, there are about eight or nine injured people, the doctors are handling the cases," said a doctor at a Ya'an hospital who gave her family name as Liu.
 
The hospital was seeing head and leg injuries, she added. 
 
"SHAKES AND TREMORS"
A resident in Chengdu, 140 km (85 miles) from Ya'an city, told Xinhua he was on the 13th floor of a building when he felt the quake. The building shook for about 20 seconds and he saw tiles fall from nearby buildings.
Ya'an is a city of 1.5 million people and is considered one of the birthplaces of Chinese tea culture and the home to one of China's main centres for protecting the giant panda.
"There are still shakes and tremors and our area is safe. The pandas are safe," said a spokesman with Ya'an's Bifengxia nature park, a tourism park that houses more than 100 pandas. 
Shouts and screams were heard in the background while Reuters was on the telephone with the spokesman.
"There was just an aftershock, an aftershock, our office is safe," he said. 
Numerous aftershocks jolted the area, the largest of which was magnitude 5.1.
Sichuan is one of the four major natural-gas-producing provinces in China, and its output accounts for about 14 percent of the nation's total.
 Sinopec Group, Asia's largest oil refiner, said its huge Puguang gas field had not been affected. 
The US Geological Survey initially put the magnitude at 7, but later revised it down.
The devastating May 2008 quake was 7.9 magnitude.
