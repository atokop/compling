Daily Horoscope for September 19

 Capricorn
It's time to tidy up as the Moon moves into your sixth house of health and service; this is a good day to organize your closet and give what you don't need to charity. If you have been overindulging in rich food and drink lately, it may be wise to stick to fresh fruits, veggies, and water today. Inner and outer cleansing is favored now.
