This global event is now commemorated in more than 192 countries each year. Google Play joins the party with this collection of Apps, Music, Books, Movie, TV and Magazines that teaches and inspires us on how to go green, whether it’s conserving energy, being awed by natural wonders, composting in the big city, or listening to music that creates an ambient landscape. A reminder that downloading digital content leaves a zero carbon footprint, so feel free to indulge as we salute the planet. Looking for more Earth Day inspiration? Meet Nature's Engineers.
