Taiwanese notebook makers in Sichuan unaffected by quake
2013/04/20 22:04:33


Taipei, April 20 (CNA) Several Taiwanese contract notebook computer makers operating in Sichuan said Saturday their factories have not been affected by a deadly quake that struck the southwestern China province earlier in the day, killing 156 people and injuring over 5,000.Taiwanese contract notebook PC makers Quanta Computer Inc., Compal Electronics Inc., and Wistron Corp. all reported that the 7.0-magnitude quake did not cause any disruptions at their factories.A spokesman for Quanta, the world's largest contract notebook manufacturer, said that its factory zone is located in the province's Chongqing area, about 400-500 kilometers away from earthquake's epicenter in Lushan County, Ya'an City.No damage has been reported at the factory and its production has not been affected, the spokesman said.Quanta's Chongqing factory has a monthly production capacity of about 1.5 million units, which accounts for 40 percent of the company's total notebook shipments.Compal Vice President Gary Lu said the earthquake, which occurred at 8:02 a.m., has not disrupted operations at the company's Chengdu factory, which currently produces more than 500,000 notebooks a month.Compal plans to gradually increase its production capacity at the Chengdu factory, where production costs are lower than in China's coastal areas.Taiwan's notebook manufacturers began aggressively venturing into Sichuan last year, setting up production bases in Chengdu and Chongqing mainly for notebook assembly.
