    	It was a long day of searching for trapped survivors, after China’s worst earthquake in three years.


    


    	 

At least 157 people are dead and 5,700 wounded after the magnitude 6.6 quake struck.

A series of aftershocks happened soon after.


    


    	 The strongest one just five minutes after the main tremor.


    


    	 

Tents have been set up outside a hospital to treat some of the injured.

The earthquake happened close to the city of Ya’an in China’s south west Sichuan province.


    


    	 

There are warnings of possible landslides in the county.


    


    	 

Thousands of soldiers are helping with the rescue efforts, hampered by water and electricity being cut off some places.

The area is prone to seismic activity.


    


    	 Almost 70,000 people died in an earthquake nearby in 2008.
