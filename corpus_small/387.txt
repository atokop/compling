Floods in Thailand leave 130 dead 
Floods in Thailand leave 130 dead 
 
Bangkok: Almost two months of severe flooding in Thailand have left at least 130 people dead, the government said on Wednesday as it stepped up efforts to protect the low-lying capital.    Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra ordered army and naval boats to be deployed with their engines running while stationary on the Chao Phraya River in the hope that the motion from the propellers speeds up the flow.    "I have ordered 30 ships to be deployed in seven locations across Bangkok and start their engines as soon as possible so we can see a quick result. This will help push water back to the sea," she told reporters.    The floods, which began in the north, have hit a total of 56 provinces, with 24 still waterlogged. The homes and livelihoods of 1.9 million people have been affected, according to the government.    "The weather this year is very severe and changeable," said Chalit Damrongsak, Director General of the Irrigation Department.
