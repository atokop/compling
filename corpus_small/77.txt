*Kelley Blue Book® Suggested Retail Value
Kelley Blue Book's Suggested Retail Value is representative of dealers' asking prices and is the starting point for negotiation between a consumer and a dealer. This value assumes that the vehicle has been fully reconditioned and takes into account the dealers' profit and costs for advertising. The final sale price will likely be less depending on the car's actual condition, popularity, warranty and local market factors.
