Sikkim Earthquake: Let’s help the people of the hills








Tweet












Today evening’s earthquake epicentred in Sikkim is a tough natural calamity to have affected the Himalayan Kingdom. My heart goes out to all the kind and helpful people of the hills. Even more so because the bulk of the population stay in the crowded hill stations of Darjeeling and Gangtok, making them even more vulnerable to a natural calamity of this magnitude.     I have very happy memories from this entire mountain belt having trekked the Singalila ridge from near Darjeeling on the Indo-Nepal border not far away from the epicentre of the quake. I am sure a lot of us have great memories of this place and would like to see things get back to normal soon. Hence, keeping that in mind, let’s try our level best to contribute to the quake relief and renovation efforts. Even a miniscule bit from each one of us will make a huge difference.     Let’s help the people affected in the Sikkim Earthquake!
