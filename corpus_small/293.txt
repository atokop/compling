Sichuan quake: Chinese government was warned of disaster
One of China's leading seismologists warned that a devastating earthquake would strike the exact area where more than 200 people have now lost their lives.

Professor Chen Yuntai, twice president of China's 
  Seismological Society, warned in the wake of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake 
  that the same fault line was likely to rupture again in the coming years. 


The warning was reported to China's top leaders in Reference News, a daily 
  internal briefing for the Communist party, but was not acted upon. 


"We collected the data from the Wenchuan earthquake and we calculated 
  that there would be another big quake around 60 miles to the south west, 
  which is Baoxing county," he said. 


"We gave a seminar organised by the Chinese Academy of Sciences 10 days 
  after the Wenchuan earthquake and a reporter for Xinhua (the state news 
  agency) wrote it up for the Politburo. 


"I shared the findings with many counterparts in Beijing and Sichuan but 
  only a few people paid any attention," he said. "I was worried 
  because I was sure that there would be this aftershock".

Prof Chen, 72, who is also the honorary dean of Peking university's School of 
  Earth and Space Sciences, said he had even calculated that the magnitude 
  would be between 6.9 and 7.3. 


The earthquake on Saturday morning in Sichuan was magnitude 7, and occurred 
  almost exactly five years after the Wenchuan quake. 


"We knew it would happen, but we did not know exactly when," said 
  Prof Chen. He explained that three quarters of the near 300-mile long 
  Longmenshan fault line had ruptured in 2008, but that pressure had built up 
  under the remaining 60 miles underneath Baoxing. 


Yang Yong, an independent geologist who is currently in the disaster zone said 
  he had also predicted a looming disaster. 


"The south west part of the fault had a lot of energy accumulating 
  underneath it. There is the intersection of many different zones. I thought 
  that after the Wenchuan earthquake another quake would happen to the south 
  in a couple of years," he said.

More than 2,200 aftershocks in the wake of the latest quake were still 
  panicking survivors and hampering rescue efforts in the mountainous area on 
  Monday. 


Four of the aftershocks have had a magnitude of 5 to 5.9 according to the 
  local seismological bureau. 


The near constant seismic activity has caused further landslides and slowed 
  rescuers battling along narrow mountain roads to reach the worst-affected 
  villages. 


"Residents and rescuers must be highly alert to the dangers of mudslides, 
  especially after rain," said Fan Xiao, chief engineer at the Sichuan 
  Geology and Mineral Bureau in Chengdu. "There will be lots of rain in 
  the coming months."


By Monday, the death toll from the earthquake had reached 213, including 25 
  missing victims. More than 11,000 people were injured, 13,000 homes were 
  destroyed and more than 220,000 people have been evacuated from the region, 
  according to the Ministry of Civil Affairs. 


"The logistics of getting the relief supplies through have been quite 
  challenging and people have had a very difficult time waiting for the most 
  basic supplies," said Francis Markus, a spokesman for the International 
  Red Cross. 


"We hope the weather does not make things worse and that the aftershocks 
  will subside as quickly as possible. 


"It is going to be a protracted difficult time for people, both 
  physically and psychologically because this region has been struck twice, so 
  in a way it is kind of a double blow," he added. 


The art of earthquake prediction remains controversial, but last October six 
  Italian scientists and an ex-government official were found guilty of 
  manslaughter and sentenced to six years in prison for failing to predict an 
  earthquake in L'Aquila in 2009. 


Seismologists have also predicted for years that a huge earthquake along the 
  San Andreas Fault will destroy large swathes of California. 


However Prof Chen said that now the Longmenshan fault has released its energy, 
  Sichuan is unlikely to suffer a further quake in the medium term. 


"In the future, there is no guarantee that there will not be a big 
  earthquake in Sichuan again, but the possibility has shrunk," he said.
