 Beijing: The earthquake that hit Sikkim and other North Eastern states in India on Sunday also rocked its neighbours Tibet and Nepal, leaving a trail of damage. A 6.8 magnitude earthquake killed nine people and injured 100 in Nepal, while a 6.9 magnitude trembler killed seven and 22 others in Tibet.  It was the biggest earthquake to hit Nepal in the past 80 years. After initial panic and chaos, prayers began to be offered in Nepal with the realisation that the earthquake that hit its eastern region and capital city Kathmandu could have wreaked far greater devastation. As the resilient Himalayan state began to limp back to normal Monday, the toll had risen to at least nine with the news of another unconfirmed casualty, while over 100 people had received injuries with hundreds of houses and buildings collapsing.The cramped capital, full of decrepit houses and little adherence to building regulations, suffered with three people dying in a wall collapse while over 50 were injured trying to jump down from windows and balconies in the panic.In Tibet, the earthquake has caused hundreds of landslides that have disrupted traffic, power and water supplies, as well as telecommunications in Yadong County, which is 40 km away from Sikkim, the epicenter of the 6.9-magnitude quake.Local authorities in Xigaze Prefecture, who administers Yadong, have mobilised workers to use heavy machinery to clear debris from major roads in order to ensure the expedient transport of relief supplies, state-run Xinhua reported today.The road traffic to the Himalayan county resumed today.Xinhua reporters arriving at the county this morning saw dozens of earthquake victims wrapped in cotton quilts camp on street enduring rain and sleet.Dianzin Namgyai, secretary of the Xigaze Prefecture committee of the Communist Party of China, visited victims in Galingang Village, one of the worst hit in the quake.He said all 156 houses in the village were damaged -- leaving villagers homeless."Relief supplies are on the way to Yadong," he said, adding that 500 tents have been sent.Wang Changlin, rector of the Yadong County Middle School, said the school had to stop classes today, as all 355 students are temporarily living in six tents.The earthquake occurred at 6:11 p.m. local time on the India-Nepal border last evening. The epicenter was located 68 km northwest of Sikkim's capital Gangtok, at a depth of 19.7 km.
