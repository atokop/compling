Four people were found shot in the head in the basement of a townhouse in an Akron, Ohio, public housing complex on Thursday, according to police.
A friend found the bodies shortly before 3 p.m., after entering the home and seeing signs of something amiss, reports NBC News. All four appeared to be shot in the head execution style. 
Police say they have not found a weapon. Investigators are canvassing the neighborhood and searching for shell casings.
Family members identified the victims to NBC Newsas Ronald Roberts, 24; Maria Nash, 19 and Kem Delaney, 23. Roberts’ family said his girlfriend, Kiana "Kiki" Welch, is the fourth person dead.
“My thoughts are that my son wouldn’t have hurt anyone. He would have given you the shirt off his back, and whoever did this needs to be found and held responsible,” Roberts’ mother told NBC. “Now, I have a 24-year-old son to put away, for what? Can you please tell me why?”
“My brother was a good kid,” said one man at the scene. “My brother was a good kid; he ain’t deserve to get killed like that. Whoever did it, I hope you turn yourself in or get found.”3

Officials predict the Mississippi River to crest at 39.4 feet on the St. Louis riverfront on April 23. That is more than nine feet over flood stage. The record crest set back in 1993 was more than 49 feet.  UPI/Bill Greenblatt
