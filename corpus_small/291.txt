A man walks past a Chinese national flag planted on debris one day after an earthquake hit Lushan county in southwestern China.
The Ya’an earthquake comes as China wrestles with slower-than-expected growth and the risk of rising inflation. But the early signs are that the impact on the economy is likely to be limited.
Sichuan is one of China’s most populous provinces and occupies a strategic location as the gateway to the rapidly developing west. But it still punches below its weight economically, with output of 2.1 trillion yuan ($340 billion) in 2011, equivalent to about 4% of the national total.
Ya’an itself is some 120 kilometers from the provincial capital Chengdu, with an economy centered on tourism, agriculture, and natural resources – including a panda research center that moved there after the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. Local GDP in 2011 was just 35 billion yuan, a fraction of the regional total, according to data provider CEIC.
Sichuan’s massive 2008 earthquake cratered growth in provincial industrial output to 3.6% year-on-year in May of that year from 24.6% in April. Even then, national output growth was largely unchanged, and by August Sichuan had recovered close to previous levels.
With the Ya’an earthquake on a smaller scale, the impact on output is likely to be smaller too. Industry in Ya’an itself appears to be limited, and so far there are few reports of consequences for firms elsewhere in the region Toyota Motor Corp.  stopped production at a plant in the province Saturday as a result of the quake, but said it would resume production Monday.
Another potential concern is higher inflation. China’s food prices are threatening to rise again, and Sichuan accounts for 4.9% of China’s agricultural land. A disruption to supply could raise bills for China’s households. Again, the lesson from the 2008 earthquake is that the impact is likely to be limited. Back then neither national nor provincial consumer prices registered an impact from the earthquake.
Even if the immediate impact on output is limited, the regional economy could still benefit from the boost given by rebuilding. In 2009, China’s economy was hit by the global financial crisis, with growth slowing to 9.2% from 9.6% in 2008. But thanks in part to the boost to investment from rebuilding, Sichuan’s growth accelerated to 14.5% year on year, up from 11% in 2008.
“We’re bullish on Sichuan’s economy,” said Alistair Thornton, regional economist at IHS. “They are the pathway to China’s fastest growing region and they will continue to benefit from that. The earthquake is a tragedy, but it’s difficult to see it pushing development off course for long.”

That’s rank dishonesty, pug.

Don’t you find the WSJ such a pity, which is why the day when the Boston bombing going on..aside from the young chinese girl, the rest of the victim I do not give a pity of them at all.
Sometimes, you just wondering why the Muslim world harbor so much hatred and bitterness against the American people. Well, I guess I know why now.

@Pacific Sentry
Did you know that the Chinese have been asking for American engineers to solve the numerous problems of the Three Gorges Dam? The Chicoms want the USA to deal with the cracks forming in the dam, deal with the sedimetation problems, the biodiversity problem, the dam itself being built on top of an active fault, and the fact that if the Three Gorges Dam collapses………………………………how Shanghai can be protected from becoming a modern day Atlantis.
Now I understand why Burma cancelled China’s attempt to build a dam in their country.

Tofu homes and shoddy construction are part of the commie master plot at enforcing the one-Chinese dud aka 1 child policy in China. The way that Xi the Gin Pig and other corrupt officials see it, it is easier to let mother nature annihilate all those Chinese ‘spares’.
Then the chicoms rush in and offer ‘assistance’- at least when the camera is rolling.
What a joke China is.
Jiayou chicoms!!!!!!!!!!

Where to Find Political Reform in China Systemic reforms to reshape China existing political institutions have yet to take place, but travel outside the capital and you’ll find no shortage of local-level trials and experiments with political reform, writes Yiyi Lu.   Bold Remembrances for a Chinese Reformer A surprising series of state media essays about former Communist Party leader Hu Yaobang, whose death helped spark the Tiananmen protests of 1989, suggests China's new president is not backing down on reform, writes CRT analyst Russ Moses.   March: China's Month of Mistakes China made four high-profile foreign policy fumbles in March and the negative repercussions they engender may ultimately come back to harm the country's own interests.   Now Sharper, Xi Jinping's 'China Dream' Marks Departure From Past Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s brand of reform is starting to look very different from what came before, writes CRT politics analyst Russell Leigh Moses.
