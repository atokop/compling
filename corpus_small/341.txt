Sikkim quake toll rises to 18 19 Sep, 2011, 0951  hrs IST, IANS

 GANGTOK:
The toll in Sikkim following Sunday's powerful 6.8 magnitude earthquake rose to
18 on Monday, an official said here.

 The high-intensity quake was
followed by two after-shocks and had its epicentre on the Sikkim-Nepal
border.

 The number of those injured in the earthquake crossed 200 as
reports came in here from different areas.

 Sikkim has been cut off
from the rest of the country with the national highway 31-A blocked in at least
eight places following heavy mudslides, said G. Anandan, district magistrate,
Sikkim East.

 As many as 25 concrete bridges were damaged between
Siliguri and Gangtok on the 120 km long national highway 31-A, he
said.

 The Sikkim secretariat also developed cracks, he
added.
