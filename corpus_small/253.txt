Among the deadliest quake the country has seen in the past three years, more than 2,000 aftershocks have rattled the area, The China Earthquake Administration said.Mountain roads blocked by rocks and landslides hampered rescue efforts to reach every village and household affected by the quake — measured at magnitude-6.6 by the U.S. Geological Survey — that struck Saturday morning in the same region where a 2008 quake took nearly 90,000 lives. The quake's shallow depth, less than 8 miles, likely magnified the impactSome 18,000 soldiers and armed police were sent to the disaster zone in sourthwestern China, and 10,000 had already reached seriously affected areas, the Chengdu Military Area Command said Sunday, according to state news agency Xinhua.The Chengdu Military Area Command also said it would send 23 helicopters. As of 4:30 p.m. local time Sunday, the Chinese air force had sent 106 planes for rescue missions, including personnel and material transportation, Xinhua said.An emergency rescue team with 200 workers organized by the China Earthquake Administration (CEA), joined their provincial counterparts in the quake zone Sunday afternoon, but bad weather delayed plans to reach hard-hit Baoxing County, which has had little contact with the outside world, according to the CEA.Chinese Premier Li Keqiang visited injured survivors Sunday before returning to Beijing, where Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said China does not currently need foreign rescue teams or medical and relief supplies. Qin said the country has guaranteed rescue and medical treatment capability and sufficient rescue materials.Luo Shiqiang sat near chunks of concrete, bricks and a ripped orange sofa and told the Associated Press how his grandfather was just returning from feeding chickens when their house collapsed and crushed him to death in the earthquake."We lost everything in such a short time," the 20-year-old college student said Sunday. He said his cousin also was injured in the collapse, but that other members of his family were spared because they were out working in the fields of hard-hit Longmen village in Lushan County.Two soldiers assisting in the rescue efforts died after their vehicle slid off a road and rolled down a cliff, state media reported.The Chinese Red Cross said it had deployed relief teams with supplies of food, water, medicine and rescue equipment to the disaster areas.However, many residents complained that although emergency teams were quick to carry away bodies and search for survivors, they had so far done little to distribute aid. "No water, no shelter," read a hand-written sign held up by children on a roadside in Longmen, according to the AP.Chinese journalist delays wedding following a 6.6 magnitude earthquake to cover the story in her wedding dress.On Saturday, state media showed images of collapsed buildings, roads blocked by fallen rocks and hundreds of people seeking medical attention at a makeshift triage center outside the county hospital in Lushan, located at the edge of the Tibetan plateau.Premier Li flew by helicopter to the quake zone in Lushan on Saturday afternoon, where he met survivors and local government and army leaders.Authorities' quick response will likely win popular support in China, where many citizens consider government officials corrupt and self-serving. However, the quake may also serve as a test of transparency for the new regime especially if evidence is uncovered that shoddy construction contributed to deaths and injuries.After the 2008 quake, authorities went to great lengths to bury bad news about the high number of schools that collapsed, killing thousands of children. It also jailed people who gathered information on the issue or tried to expose the corrupt practices that had led to the poorly built schools.In the immediate aftermath of Saturday's quake, Chinese Internet users focused on trying to help. Bloggers in the quake zone turned Saturday to Sina Weibo, a Twitter-like service, to call for assistance.Organizations and individuals quickly responded with volunteer action, including Li Chengpeng, a Sichuan-based writer and former soccer commentator, whose profile as a social critic rose after the 2008 disaster when he joined rescue efforts and saw the schools firsthand. On his Sina Weibo account, which has millions of followers, Li posted Saturday that he had organized an expert rescue team to send to Ya'an, and welcomed donations of money or manpower.Other volunteer efforts also spread via Weibo. Inspirational stories emerged, including one about local Ya'an television anchorwoman Chen Ying, who rushed to file reports while dressed in her wedding gown on her wedding day. And Chinese Central Television reported that the giant pandas were safe in the country's biggest panda research center in Ya'an, located about 26 miles from the epicenter.Contributing: Sunny Yang; The Associated Press
