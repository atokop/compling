Bangalore: A teenage girl was killed and ten persons, including six fire force personnel, were injured when a two-storeyed house collapsed after a domestic cooking gas cylinder burst in an adjoining marriage hall here on Wednesday, police said.The body of the 17-year old girl, reported missing after the collapse, was found under the debris, they said.Police suspect the building collapsed after the cylinder exploded in the adjoining Lakshmi Venkateshwara Choultry causing a fire. "The explosion led to a reaction on some chemical substance stored on the ground floor of the collapsed building," police said.The mishap occurred around 1.30 pm when six fire personnel and four inmates of the house were present in the residential building, Police Commissioner B G Jyotiprakah Mirji said."All the ten injured have been shifted to Lakshminarayan Nursing Home and they are all out of danger," he said.He said the fire has been brought under control and police was investigating to know the cause for the mishap.As many as 100 fire personnel were pressed into the service to fight the fire.
