Did you not see the caption under his name..FORMER GOVERNOR OF MASSACHUSETTS, Boston is in Massachusetts, there was a terror attack in the state in which he governed..hence Mitt Romney was given 2 minutes to speak his mind. The man can't even say something nice at a prayer service after a TERROR attack w/o getting heckled. Grow up and leave the election rage behind already. There are plenty of old campaign vids where you can pathetically continue to bash him, show a little respect on this﻿ one.

Romney is impressed with whoever can﻿ put together a sentence that has more than five words. He is like Bush's evil clone.
Driving down the road you can practically hear what they are thinking.... car,car,car,tree,tree,tree, house, car
