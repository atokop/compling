AFP
Thousands of rescuers are combing flattened villages in southwest China in a race to find survivors of a powerful quake as the toll of dead and missing rises past 200.
Dressed in bright orange uniforms, they battled their way on Sunday up mountain paths strewn with wreckage to reach isolated parts of Sichuan province on the edge of the Tibetan Plateau.
Army troops dressed in camouflage worked through the night, searching villages for survivors and treating the injured.
China's new Premier Li Keqiang has rushed to the disaster zone and was shown by state broadcaster CCTV eating breakfast in a tent. He told state media "the rescue effort is our first duty".

Li said on Saturday the first 24 hours was "the golden time for saving lives", as China's new leaders respond to a fresh disaster five years after another Sichuan earthquake left more than 90,000 dead or missing.
But the rescue operation was hampered by huge queues of traffic - some stretching back for 20 kilometres - clogging roads into the disaster zone.
"We really want to go in and help people, but instead we are waiting in traffic," one frustrated relief official said in his car, as large numbers of volunteer rescuers from local communities tried to head to the zone.
Boulders the size of cars littered streets in Lushan county, the epicentre of the earthquake.
"Three people died in that building, and no one wants to live in this area any more because it is too dangerous," a 45-year man surnamed Yang told AFP, surrounded by rubble from the quake.
More than 1100 aftershocks have followed since the quake struck Sichuan on Saturday morning. Chinese seismologists registered the tremor at 7.0 magnitude while the US Geological Survey gave it as 6.6.
At least 179 people have been confirmed dead, 24 are missing and nearly 11,500 were injured, the Ministry of Civil Affairs said.
Firefighters helped by sniffer dogs have pulled 91 people alive from the rubble, the Xinhua news agency said, citing the Ministry of Public Security.
At Lushan People's Hospital, a steady stream of ambulances continued to arrive in the early hours of Sunday. Most victims were taken to tents erected in the grounds of the hospital, where doctors treated the wounded.
Quake-prone Japan, which has been mired in tension with China over a high-seas territorial dispute, has offered any help required.
China says overseas assistance is not needed at the moment but it will contact Japan if that changes.
