U-19 captain dropped after age fudging
 



New Delhi: The BCCI on Wednesday was left red-faced after Maharashtra batsman Ankit Bawne, who was named captain of the India U-19 squad for a quadrangular tournament, had to be dropped following revelations that he provided inaccurate information about his age.The BCCI named Unmukt Chand as the captain while Kumar Deobrat of Jharkhand was officially named the vice-captain."As there is U-19 World Cup due to be held in Australia next year, the cut-off date for players eligible are those born on and after September 1, 1992," a senior board official informed.According to the BCCI database, Bawne's official date of birth is December 17, 1992 but now it has been learnt that his passport states a DOB that is before September 1, 1992.While chairman of junior selectors Abey Kuruvilla refused to comment on the issue, another member of the junior selection committee revealed what Bawne has told the board officials about the "age goof-up" in his passport."Ankit told us that he got his passport made by an agent who had goofed up his date of birth due to which this discrepancy happened. Well, that issue can be sorted out but as of now we can't take any chance with him," the selection committee member preferring anonymity said.However, it is learnt that no action will be taken against Bawne although it is the cricketer who has provided wrong information."Look, it's not only the board which has to pay a price for wrong information but also the cricketer. Isn't he already paying a price for providing wrong information that he won't play for national team," the official questioned.
The BCCI named Karnataka's Shreyash Gopal as the replacement for Bawne.About Unmukt being preferred for captaincy over Kumar Deobrat, the official said, "There is no such rule that we have to name the vice-captain as the leader. Unmukt had a very good domestic season and that's why we thought of giving him the exposure."
