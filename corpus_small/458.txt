BY DANFES, AGENCY
The toll in Sikkim due to Sunday's 6.8 magnitude earthquake has reached 18, an official in state capital Gangtok said Monday.
Around 150 people were injured following the tremor that had its epicentre on the Sikkim-Nepal border.
Sikkim has been cut off from the rest of the country with the national highway 31-A blocked in at least eight places following heavy mudslides, said G. Anandan, district magistrate, Sikkim East, who is also in charge of the control room in Gangtok.
At least 25 concrete bridges were damaged between Siliguri to Gangtok on the 120-km-long national highway 31-A, he said.
The Sikkim secretariat also developed cracks, he added.
