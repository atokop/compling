New Delhi: At least 28 people have lost their lives and over 100 injured after a 6.8 magnitude earthquake hit Sikkim on Sunday evening. Authorities fear the toll could rise further. The exact extent of damages is yet to be assessed as relief and rescue is yet to reach affected areas.
Out of the 28 dead, 19 are from Sikkim, two from Bihar and five in West Bengal. Two Army personnel are also reported to have been killed in the quake in North Sikkim.

The Bagdogra airbase has been made the centre of all operations.

These columns comprise medical teams with first aid kits as well as engineers. Four-hundred personnel from the National Disaster Relief Force have reached Bagdogra from where they will move by road. 
Thirty columns from the 33 Corps in Siliguri are also engaged in rescue activity. Bihar has sent 160 personnel to help in the relief efforts. The BSF rescue team and the dog squad have also been pressed into service.
Indo-Tibetan Border Police personnel rescued 200 civilians including 22 tourists. All of them have taken refuge at the Pegong camp. An IAF team carrying supplies is on its way.
Sources on Monday said that the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) has restored traffic on National Highway No 31. The highway was blocked after landslides occurred in the area due to heavy rainfall.
Almost 105 columns of Army personnel have been sent In the research and rescue operations for the areas affected by the Sunday earthquake.
The Army has also provided shelter to 1500 persons and is running around ten cookhouses.
