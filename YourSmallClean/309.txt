Rescue crews struggle to reach quake victims in China | News | DW.DE | 21.04.2013 

China's earthquake has left more than 200 people dead or missing. Rescuers are struggling to get supplies to the hardest-hit areas owing to damaged roads and traffic. Nearly 12,000 people were injured in the quake.

Rescuers in China were struggling on Sunday to reach survivors from a 6.6 magnitude quake in the southwestern province of Sichuan. In addition to damaged roads and traffic, the region has been plagued by more than 1,300 aftershocks.

The quake struck in Lushan county, near the city of Ya'an, on Saturday morning. Since then, the death and missing toll has risen to above 200, with nearly 1,000 others suffering from serious injuries.

Teams struggled to reach the area owing to narrow, damaged roads, landslides and traffic. Rescue crews and armed police fought their way up narrow mountain paths covered in debris in order to reach the isolated areas of Sichuan province, such as Baoxing, one of the areas hardest hit by the quake.

"We're in a hurry. There are people that need help and we have supplies in the back (of the car)," a man from the Shandong Province Earthquake Emergency Response Team told the Reuters news agency.

Many of the earthquake victims were already poor and are now facing homelessness.

Many in the region were still in the process of rebuilding after the 2008 Sichuan earthquake that killed 70,000. Saturday’s tremor, though milder in comparison, has added a new layer of hardship to residents’ lives.
