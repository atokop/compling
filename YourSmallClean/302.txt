British aid workers are sending life-saving supplies to those affected by the earthquake that has hit south west China, killing more than 150 people.

Foreign Secretary William Hague has offered his "deepest condolences" to all those Chinese citizens affected by the quake.

He added: "I am saddened to hear of the tragic loss of life and destruction caused by today's earthquake in Sichuan Province in China.  

"Repeated earthquakes hit affected people's mind hard and children, particularly, are most vulnerable."‚Äù

 "Today's events will no doubt bring back terrible memories of the catastrophic earthquake in the same province in 2008. 

A British Red Cross spokesman said the charity was mobilising 5,000 kits of household items, 5,000 quilts, 5,000 warm jackets and 1,200 tents for the earthquake survivors.

The earthquake struck the steep hills of Lushan county at 08:02 local time (00:02 GMT), triggering landslides and leaving thousands of homes destroyed.

More than 90,000 people were killed when a 7.9 magnitude earthquake struck the region in May 2008. World Vision said it then helped an estimated 2.2 million people rebuild their lives.

Its head of disaster response and preparedness, Unni Krishnan, said: "Repeated earthquakes hit affected people's mind hard and children, particularly, are most vulnerable."
