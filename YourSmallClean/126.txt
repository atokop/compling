Strong quake hits southwestern China, killing more than 100 - CNN.com

People attempt to move a huge rock blocking the road to Longmen township, an area close to the epicenter of the 7.0 magnitude earthquake that hit China's southwest Sichuan province on Saturday, April 20. More than 100 people were killed and 3,000 injured.

Hong Kong (CNN) -- A strong earthquake struck the southwestern Chinese province of Sichuan on Saturday, killing more than 100 people and injuring thousands of others in a region that suffered a catastrophic quake five years ago, authorities said.

The death toll rose steadily through the day. It currently stands at 113, with more than 3,000 people injured, the China Earthquake Administration said, according to state broadcaster CCTV.

Xu Mengjia, the Communist Party chief of Ya'an, the city that administers the area where the quake struck, told CCTV that because of landslides and disruption to communications, determining the total number of casualties may take some time.

The quake struck just after 8 a.m. local time about 115 kilometers (70 miles) away from the provincial capital, Chengdu, at a depth of around 12 kilometers, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. There was conflicting information about the earthquake's strength, with the USGS putting the magnitude at 6.6 and the China Earthquake Networks Center gauging it at 7.0.

The event stirred memories of the devastating earthquake that hit Sichuan in 2008, killing more than 87,000 people.

First responders to Saturday's quake reported that the damage caused didn't appear to be as severe as what was seen in the aftermath of the 2008 disaster, according to CCTV.

"I thought it was my roommates shaking the bed," he said. "But the shock became stronger soon, and it came to me that an earthquake happened."

Residents of Chongqing, a sprawling metropolis more than 300 kilometers from Ya'an, said the quake also shook buildings there.
