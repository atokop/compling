GANGTOK/NEW DELHI: The death toll in the powerful Sunday earthquake has increased to 80 with many people being killed in Sikkim, five in West Bengal, two in Bihar, seven each in Nepaland Tibet even as rescue and relief operations were stepped up in the affected areas.

Nearly 400 personnel of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) reached the Bagdogra airport on Monday morning. The NDRF personnel will be airlifted to the epicentre of the earthquake for the rescue operation. Five more rescue teams have also left Kolkata for Gangtok.

The earthquake has also triggered off landslides, blocking off nearly all roads towards Sikkim’s capital Gangtok. Personnel of the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) are working on a war footing to clear the blocked roads.

Meanwhile, the quake was felt all the way to Delhi as well as in Bangladesh, shaking buildings. At least 10 people were injured and some buildings suffered minor damage.

Chinese state-run news agency Xinhua reported that at least seven persons have been killed and 22 others injured in Tibet in the quake which has caused landslides and has disrupted traffic, power and water supplies as well as telecommunication in Yadong County, an area 40 km away from Sikkim.
