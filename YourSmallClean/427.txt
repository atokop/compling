Gangtok: The Indo-Tibetan Border Police has launched search and rescue operations in Pegong area of north Sikkim which has been "badly affected" with two ITBP buildings also collapsing after the state was rocked by a powerful earthquake.

The search and rescue operations are getting hampered because there is no electricity in the quake hit areas.

The quake measuring 6.8 on Richter Scale with its epicentre on the Sikkim-Nepal border shook northeast and northern parts of the country, including the national capital, on Sunday evening.
