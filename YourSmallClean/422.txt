A boring Sunday afternoon turned into a rocking (literally) show of power by nature as a massive earthquake of magnitude 6.9 Mw hit Sikkim and nearby areas. With people experiencing the earth shaking underneath, the rain gods didn’t show any mercy either and heavy rainfall only made matters worse.

Instantly I saw people around me running around trying to escape. It was the earthquake. I tried to calm myself expecting that the quake will just halt (it usually does) and that it was no good to panic. But my next sight left me horrified. It was a part of the ceiling falling right in front of the big screen. It was no ordinary earthquake.

Somehow we reached our car and left for home. A motorcycle accident some distance ahead was the next thing I saw on the road. “How much worse is it going to get?”, I wondered. Upon reaching home and finding everyone safe, I took a sigh of relief. However, I was still not able to contact my friends in my college Sikkim Manipal Institute of Technology, not very far from the epicenter of the earthquake.

The overall damage total is still being calculated as the effect of the earthquake is spread across many regions including countries of India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan. The administration has also started the following helpline numbers which can be reached for any queries:
