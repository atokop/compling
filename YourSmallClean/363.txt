The northern and eastern parts of the country were jolted on Sunday after a powerful earthquake hit the Sikkim-Nepal border with a magnitude of 6.8 at 6.10 p.m., leaving at least 17 persons dead and more than 100 injured, besides causing extensive damage to buildings and roads. 

The main quake was followed by three significantly high aftershocks — 5.7 at 6.21 p.m., 5.3 at 6.42 p.m. and 4.6 at 7.24 p.m. Senior officials of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said more aftershocks were likely, considering the magnitude of the quake. 

A report from Bihar said an NTPC plant at Bhagalpur was shut down immediately after the quake as a precautionary measure. In the State, the two deaths, of a five-year-old girl and a youth, occurred in Nalanda and Darbhanga districts 

“The Prime Minister himself is monitoring the developments connected to the quake,” said Mr. Seth.

After the earthquake, the Siliguri-Gangtok road has been blocked and 10 Army Engineering columns have been deployed to open it for moving rescue and relief and other engineering equipment to the region.
