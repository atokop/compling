 YA'AN, China — Residents huddled outdoors on Saturday night in a town near the epicenter of a powerful earthquake that struck the steep hills of China's southwestern Sichuan province, leaving at least 160 people dead and more than 6,700 injured. 

 The magnitude-6.6 tremor sent people fleeing from buildings on Saturday morning, triggered landslides and disrupted phone and power connections in mountainous Lushan county only five years after a devastating quake wreaked widespread damage to the same region.  

 The quake  struck about 8 a.m., when many people were at home, sleeping or having breakfast. People in their underwear and wrapped in blankets ran into the streets of Ya'an and even the provincial capital of Chengdu, 70 miles east of Lushan, according to videos and accounts posted online. 

 Villages close to the epicenter were left in ruins. The quake's shallow depth, less than 8 miles, likely magnified the impact. 

 “We don't feel safe sleeping at home tonight,” said Wang, a student. She said the quake left tears on the walls of her family's house. “It was very scary when it happened. I ran out of my bed and out of the house. I didn't even have my shoes on.” 

 Lushan, where the quake struck, sits atop the Longmenshan fault. It was along that fault line that a devastating magnitude-7.9 quake struck on May 12, 2008, leaving more than 90,000 people dead or missing and presumed dead.
