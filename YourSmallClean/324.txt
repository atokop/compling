6.9 India quake - 'many dead'

GUWAHATI, India â€” A powerful 6.9-magnitude earthquake rocked northeastern India on Sunday, killing as many as eight people, including five who died in tremors that rocked neighbouring Nepal.

The US Geological Survey said the quake hit the small, landlocked Himalayan state of Sikkim - which borders Nepal, Bhutan and Tibet - at around 6:10pm (7.10pom Thailand Time, 1240 GMT).

The epicentre was just over 60 kilometres (40 miles) northwest of the state capital Gangtok, which was plunged into darkness by a power cut of about 20 seconds after the quake.

Sikkim Chief Secretary Karma Gyatso told the channel, "It was a massive earthquake. We have alerted the armed forces and the paramilitary."
