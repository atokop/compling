The earthquake-affected areas of Darjeeling district are limping back to normalcy. In Kalimpong and Kurseong sub-divisions, people braved inclement weather to stay outdoors after a 6.8 magnitude quake rattled the area on Sunday evening. On Tuesday, they started returning home. But panic still prevails in the area.

As many as 68 people are believed to have died in Sunday's earthquake. In New Delhi, Union home secretary R.K. Singh said the death toll in Sikkim has reached 50.

As the extent of damage caused by the quake unfolded gradually, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh spoke to Sikkim chief minister Pawan Kumar Chamling again on Tuesday to assure him the Centre would do everything needed to deal with the situation.

The number of people killed in the quake in West Bengal rose to 12 with eight deaths reported in Darjeeling district, three in North Dinajpur and one in Jalpaiguri.

In Sikkim, the army has managed to reach Mangan - the epicentre of the quake - with relief material. The NH-55 from Bagdogra to Darjeeling has been restored while work is on to clear the highway that connects Gangtok with Nathu La, the police said.

About 5,500 personnel from the army and the National Disaster Relief Force (NDRF) were engaged in clearing roads. Even in the best of times the road infrastructure in the state is not good. The earthquake has made it worse, an army officer said. The army itself has taken a hit as it has a big presence in the strategically sensitive region. One of the biggest challenges facing the rescue teams was to restore communication lines.
