Chen Fuzhen was bathing her infant son when the earthquake struck Longmen early on Saturday morning.

Dozens of others in Longmen, one of the counties worst affected by the 7.0-magnitude earthquake that struck Sichuan province, were not as lucky. Many lost their lives as more than 5,000 of the 7,000 homes there collapsed.

The earthquake, Chinese media reports say, has been particularly devastating because of its impact on the elderly and young children, who have had to cope with the disaster with little help.

“If the men were at home when the earthquake happened, maybe more people would have been saved or uninjured,” Zhang Qingqiu (31), mother of a nine-month-old, told the newspaper, which also reported Chen Fuzhen’s story. Ms. Chen’s husband was employed in the booming municipality of Chongqing, which lies a few hundred km east of Longmen and was carved out of Sichuan province 15 years ago.

Teachers at the Longmen primary school were quoted as saying there were dozens of “left-behind” students who will have to deal with the quake’s aftermath on their own.

As of Monday, at least 192 people were reported to have died in the earthquake, with 23 missing. At least 11,470 were injured, among whom 968 were in a serious condition.

More than 19,000 soldiers have been dispatched to quake-hit areas to continue the search for survivors and to resettle 24,000 people, the official Xinhua news agency reported, while the government has announced a $ 1 billion Yuan ($ 161 million) relief fund.
