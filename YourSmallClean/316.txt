		The death toll from a powerful earthquake Saturday in southwest China's Sichuan province has climbed to more than 160 people, with more than 6,700 injured.

Chinese officials called it a 7.0-magnitude quake, while the U.S. Geological Survey put the strength at 6.6. The quake occurred at a depth of 13 kilometers.

After the quake, state media said hard-hit parts of Lushan county were unreachable by road, with phone services cut off.Â  Xinhua said the quake also rattled buildings in the provincial capital of Chengdu, 115 kilometers to the east.

The incident brings back painful memories for Sichuan, which suffered a 2008 earthquake that killed more than 70,000 people.
