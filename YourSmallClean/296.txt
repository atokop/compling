BEIJING — Aftershocks and landslides continue to challenge rescue efforts in China’s Sichuan province on Monday as teams rush to reach isolated parts of the quake-struck area.

China's worst earthquake in the past three years, which struck early Saturday, has already left 188 people dead and toppled or damaged more than 170,000 buildings and homes.

Although Sun has not been to any of the affected areas, she has posted pictures online that her fellow volunteers have taken from areas in the quake zone.

Although areas such as Baoxing escaped the Wenchuan quake's destruction, Ya’An, the epicenter of Saturday’s earthquake, did not.

During the 2008 quake, more than 600,000 homes were damaged there and nearly 100,000 were left homeless. The majority of deaths from Saturday’s quake occurred in Ya’An.

Saturday’s quake was measured a magnitude-7 by Chinese authorities and 6.6 by the U.S. Geological Survey. It struck on the same fault line as a devastating 2008 Wenchuan earthquake that left nearly 90,000 people dead.

Xinhua said the quake rattled buildings in the provincial capital, Chengdu, 115 kilometers to the east.

The incident brings back painful memories for Sichuan, which suffered a 2008 earthquake that killed more than 70,000 people.
