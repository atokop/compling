The powerful earthquake that rocked China has claimed 165 lives so far andÂ injured more than 6,700, according to state media reports.

The quake that southwest China on Saturday wrecked homes and triggered landslides in an area devastated by a major tremor in 2008.

The shallow earthquake struck Sichuan on the edge of the Tibetan Plateau just after 8:00 am, triggering a major rescue operation in the province where 87,000 people were reported dead or missing five years ago.

Eight hours after the quake hit Lushan county in the city of Ya'an, the death toll stood at 102, CCTV news said, quoting the China Earthquake Administration. At least 10,000 homes were destroyed, the Sichuan government said.

Local seismologists registered the quake at magnitude 7.0 while the US Geological Survey gave it as 6.6. More than 260 aftershocks followed, the People's Daily said on its website.

"The current most urgent issue is grasping the first 24 hours since the quake's occurrence, the golden time for saving lives," Xinhua quoted Li as saying.

A resident in Chengdu, 140 km (85 miles) from Ya'an city, told Xinhua he was on the 13th floor of a building when he felt the quake. The building shook for about 20 seconds and he saw tiles fall from nearby buildings.

The devastating May 2008 quake was 7.9 magnitude.
