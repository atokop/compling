QIONGLAI, China — The earthquake that shook Sichuan Province on Saturday struck at 8 a.m., when people were rising a little later than usual, and when schools and universities were closed.

China’s Ministry of Civil Affairs, which has a role in disaster relief, said on its Web site that as of 9 p.m. in Beijing, the known death toll from the earthquake in Sichuan Province was 157, with most of the dead in Ya’an. The ministry also said that about 5,700 people had been injured.        

For residents of Lushan County, the epicenter of Saturday’s earthquake, the events evoked eerie memories of a devastating earthquake in May 2008 when more than 70,000 people were killed in Chengdu, about 70 miles east of Lushan.        

Saturday’s quake had a preliminary magnitude of 7, according to the Chinese authorities. The United States Geological Survey said that the earthquake occurred on the Longmenshan fault line, the same one responsible for the 7.9 magnitude quake in 2008. But more than 12 hours after the initial temblor, the impact seemed to be far less severe.        

“The current most-urgent issue is grasping the first 24 hours after the quake’s occurrence, the golden time for saving lives, to take scientific rescue measures and save people’s lives,” Xinhua, the state news agency, quoted Mr. Li as saying.        

The 2008 quake raised questions about poorly constructed schools that collapsed and killed thousands of students.        

That earthquake prompted an extensive official relief effort and a passionate outpouring of volunteer help. But some quake-stricken residents and observers faulted the government for sending rescue efforts to the wrong places, or for failing to muster the equipment needed to lift victims from under slabs of concrete and brick. Instead, many troops and rescuers clambered over the rubble with sticks and spades.        

This time, the government appears intent on avoiding any accusations of laggardness, even if the quake was less destructive than the one in 2008. In one notable gesture, CCTV, the state broadcaster, posted photographs online of Mr. Li and other senior leaders sitting on a plane bound for Sichuan. State news media also said that Mr. Li and President Xi Jinping had convened an emergency meeting earlier in the day to coordinate rescue efforts.        

The Longmenshan fault line, which runs between the Tibetan plateau and Sichuan Basin, is seismically active. Twelve earthquakes with a magnitude of 5 or greater have occurred along the fault line since 1900, said Jiang Haikun, an official with the China Earthquake Administration.        

Sichuan Province is also one of China’s best-known habitats for pandas, and at the Bifengxia reserve, about six miles north of Ya’an, workers said that 20 pandas in the park were safe. “We inspected the panda area after the quake, and they were unaffected,” said Chen Yong, the media relations officer of the reserve.
