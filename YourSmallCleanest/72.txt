A Chinese mother met with double tragedy when her daughter was killed in a strong earthquake that struck southwest China over the weekend, five years after another one left her son dead, a report said.

The adult daughter of Lu Jingkang, 50, was crushed when her home collapsed in the quake that hit Sichuan province on Saturday, the Yangtze Evening Post reported on Sunday.

Lu lost her son after a massive earthquake hit Sichuan in 2008 and left 90,000 people dead or missing. He was fatally injured when an aftershock from the quake caused him to crash his motorcycle, the report said.

At least 188 people were killed in Saturday's quake, while some 17,000 families have lost their homes. Rescue workers rushing to the scene have been hampered by blocked roads and landslides.
