                                            Students gather outside a school in China's Sichuan province after an earthquake April 20. A large temblor struck the province Saturday morning, kiilling at least 28 people. 

 BEIJING -- A strong earthquake struck China’s Sichuan province on Saturday morning, state media said, and early reports from the scene indicated significant injuries and at least 41 deaths.

The earthquake’s epicenter was about 80 miles southwest of the provincial capital, Chengdu, in Lushan County near the small city of Yaan.

But the damage did not appear anywhere close in scale to that of a 2008 earthquake nearby that caused nearly 90,000 deaths, one of the worst natural disasters in recent Chinese history.

Chinese authorities assessed the magnitude of the quake at 7.0;  the U.S. Geological Survey reported 6.6.

The 8 a.m. quake jolted residents out of bed. People ran into the streets wearing their pajamas, according to reports from the scene.

The quake brought back terrifying memories of the May 12, 2008, earthquake along the same fault line running through the mountainous province.

Chengdu’s airport was closed immediately after the quake but has since reopened.

Sichuan’s seismological bureau reported that as many as 100 people may have been injured or killed by a quake of this strength.
