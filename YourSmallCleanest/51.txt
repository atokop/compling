PM expresses condolences on Sichuan quake | Voxy.co.nz

Prime Minister John Key has today expressed condolences to the families of those who have lost their lives in the Sichuan earthquake, and those still waiting for news about loved ones.

"A 6.6 magnitude earthquake hit the Sichuan province in southwest China yesterday," says Mr Key.

"New Zealanders understand all too well the devastation that can be caused by earthquakes. We were hugely grateful for Chinaâ€™s support following the Christchurch earthquake and New Zealand helped respond to the 2008 Sichuan quake.

"At this stage, there are no reports of any foreign nationals being injured in the earthquake. However, the New Zealand Embassy in Beijing will continue to monitor the situation closely," says Mr Key.
