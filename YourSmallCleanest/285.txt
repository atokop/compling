China is continuing a massive rescue operation in Sichuan province, deploying thousands of workers, after a powerful earthquake on Saturday. 

At least 188 people are known to have died in the quake, says state media. 

More than 11,500 others have also been reported injured since the 6.6 magnitude quake struck at 08:02 local time (00:02 GMT).

Correspondents say the hill villages, where farmers grow rice, vegetables and corn on terraced plots, were hit the hardest by the earthquake.

Sichuan province was also devastated by a massive quake five years ago that claimed tens of thousands of lives and left five million without homes. 

Although on the same fault line, this earthquake was much less powerful than the previous one. 

Once again, though, it is the poor who have born the brunt of the disaster, with the biggest killer not the earthquake itself but poorly-constructed houses, our correspondent adds.
