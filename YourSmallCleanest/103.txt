The earthquake, initially thought to be a 7.0 magnitude quake, occurred at 8.02 a.m. (0002 GMT).

The earthquake occurred at a depth of about 12 kilometers, a shallow earthquake known to do extensive damage, the U.S. Geological Survey said.  The event most likely occurred along the Longmenshan fault. A magnitude 7.9 earthquake had earlier hit the Sichuan province in May 2008.

People in the provincial capital Chengdu said that they felt the earthquake.                       

Chinese Premier Li Keqiang visited the earthquake-hit region.

"The current most urgent issue is grasping the first 24 hours after the quake's occurrence, the golden time for saving lives, to take scientific rescue measures and save peoples' lives," Li said, Xinhua reported.
