Earthquake levels buildings, kills at least 160 in Sichuan, China - UPI.com

BEIJING, April 20 (UPI) -- The earthquake that rocked Sichuan province in Southwest China early Saturday killed at least 160 people, officials said.

By just after midnight local time Sunday, officials said 6,700 people had been injured by the quake, Xinhua, the official government news agency, reported. The Chinese seismological center put the magnitude of the quake at 7.0 on the Richter scale, somewhat higher than the 6.6 measured by the U.S. Geological Survey.

The quake occurred on the same fault as the massive 2008 earthquake that killed almost 90,000 people, the Los Angeles Times reported.

The quake hit just after 8 a.m., the U.S. Geological Survey reported. It was centered in Ya'an, The New York Times said. The quake's center was 7.5 miles below the surface, a relatively shallow depth that usually indicates a potential for extensive damage.

"The current most urgent issue is grasping the first 24 hours after the quake's occurrence, the golden time for saving lives, to take scientific rescue measures and save people's lives," Li told Xinhua.
