 Two of the largest air companies in China have set aside 15 passenger airlines, three cargo planes and three helicopters for rescue efforts taking place in Ya’an, Sichuan province, which was jolted by a 7.0-magnitude earthquake on Saturday morning.

"By later today, we can have about 20 aircraft on call for rescue purposes," said Li Jiang, director of the Shanghai-based company’s publicity department. “We are in close contact with the earthquake rescue headquarters and are already on the move at their orders.”
