A strong magnitude-6.6 earthquake that struck south-west China has killed at least 150 people and left thousands injured.The quake struck China's Sichuan province just after 8:00am (local time) at a depth of 12 kilometres, sending panicked residents fleeing into the streets, some of them still in their pyjamas, and was followed by several aftershocks.The earthquake struck close to the site of the devastating quake that killed almost 70,000 people in 2008.Local seismologists registered the quake at magnitude 7.0 while the US Geological Survey (USGS) gave it as 6.6.Premier Li Keqiang, who has arrived at the disaster zone, stressed the need to "grasp the first 24 hours" to save as many lives as possible.The death toll is expected to increase but not to the catastrophic levels seen in 2008.The USGS said "significant" casualties were likely and that "extensive damage is probable and disaster is likely widespread"."Past events with this alert level have required a national or international level response," it added.The tremors were felt as far as the megacity of Chongqing, home to around 30 million people, several hundred kilometres to the east.

I think we're going to see [the death toll] go up potentially into the hundreds, because the town where the epicentre was they're saying half the buildings there were knocked down. Hopefully they were not at home at the time ... they might have been out working or going about their daily business. Thousands of soldiers and emergency workers heading into the worst-hit areas. The hope is that this quake... was actually quite deep and also in areas that are not as densely populated as the 2008 earthquake epicentre was.

 State news agency Xinhua showed images of residents outside their apartment buildings after the quake and said 6,000 troops and police were being dispatched to the area.It quoted a resident in the provincial capital Chengdu, who was on the 13th floor when the quake hit, as saying he felt the shaking for about 20 seconds and saw tiles fall off nearby buildings.In downtown Chongqing, Xinhua quoted a resident said: "I saw the lamps were swaying and water in my fishbowl stirring."Buildings have collapsed at the epicentre in Longmen and also in nearby Lushan.Some roads and bridges in the area have also collapsed.Users of the Twitter-like Sina Weibo said they felt the quake in a number of surrounding cities.The 2008 quake, which struck west-northwest of Chengdu, generated an outpouring of support, with volunteers rushing to the scene to offer aid and then-premier Wen Jiabao also visiting.

 The disaster flattened swathes of the province along with parts of neighbouring Shaanxi and Gansu.But there was public anger after the discovery that many schools fell while other buildings did not, creating suspicion of corruption and corner-cutting in construction.The deaths of the children became a sensitive and taboo subject in the heavily-controlled domestic media and social media websites.Earthquakes frequently strike the country's southwest, with twin tremors in neighbouring Yunnan province last September triggering landslides that left at least 80 people dead. Houses were toppled and people slept outdoors for fear of aftershocks, as emergency workers struggled to clear mountain roads blocked by the landslides to reach survivors.A magnitude-5.5 earthquake in Yunnan last June killed four people and injured more than 100. Another 5.4 tremor the year before near the border with Myanmar left 25 people dead and injured 250.The devastating 2008 quake was 7.9 magnitude.ABC/wires
