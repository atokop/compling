Eighteen thousand Chinese troops have been deployed to help in the aftermath of Saturday's earthquake. The rescuers have now reached Longmen and other villages that surround the quake's epicentre. 

 But throughout this high valley, in every village and settlement now, homes are smashed, rubble lies in the streets, and roofs have caved in: the destruction brought by the shockwaves from the earthquake.

And everywhere too now there is fear. People live in fear of the next tremor. There have been hundreds of aftershocks in the 36 hours since the quake.

While we were in Longmen several shocks hit. People, already traumatised by the original quake shrieked, grabbed their children, and rushed to get away from any large buildings still standing. 

"It was terrifying when the earthquake struck," Chen Yue Xian told us. 

"We have not got anything, only three bottles of mineral water each since the earthquake. The children are starved." 

One military officer in Longmen complained that the worst thing about this earthquake was the road up here. "All those volunteers bringing two packets of instant noodles each blocking the roads."
