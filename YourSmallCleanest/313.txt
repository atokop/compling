Chinese rescue teams have reached some of the most remote areas of Sichuan province hit by Saturday's powerful earthquake, state media report.

State media say 207 people are dead or missing after the quake, and 11,500 are injured, 960 of them seriously.

More than 1,300 aftershocks have been felt in the area since the 6.6 magnitude quake struck at 08:02 local time (00:02 GMT) on Saturday, raising fears of possible landslides. 

Chen Yong, the vice-director of the Ya'an city government earthquake response office, said the death toll may not rise much more.

Sichuan province was devastated by a massive quake five years ago that claimed tens of thousands of lives and left five million without homes.
