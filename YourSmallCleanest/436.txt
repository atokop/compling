As for me, I was in my hometown Siliguri when the quake took place. I was watching the movie "Mere Brother Ki Dulhan" when suddenly the ceiling started falling. Luckily, I managed to get out unharmed. 

			5min earthquake, 1min terrible shaking @ my place.

			North-East is always a epicenter of earth-quake...

			Felt shake at 6.12Pm, Kolkata.1st felt that my head was spinning but later saw the breaking news about earthquake.Yes really sad that many innocent people has lost their lives (
