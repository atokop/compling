Thousands of rescuers are combing flattened villages in southwest China in a race to find survivors of a powerful quake as the toll of dead and missing rises past 200.

Li said on Saturday the first 24 hours was "the golden time for saving lives", as China's new leaders respond to a fresh disaster five years after another Sichuan earthquake left more than 90,000 dead or missing.

Boulders the size of cars littered streets in Lushan county, the epicentre of the earthquake.

"Three people died in that building, and no one wants to live in this area any more because it is too dangerous," a 45-year man surnamed Yang told AFP, surrounded by rubble from the quake.

More than 1100 aftershocks have followed since the quake struck Sichuan on Saturday morning. Chinese seismologists registered the tremor at 7.0 magnitude while the US Geological Survey gave it as 6.6.
