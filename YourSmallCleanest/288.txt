The death toll from Saturday’s devastating earthquake in China’s southwestern Sichuan province rose by at least three dozen overnight, as rescuers battled to reach hundreds of people believed to be still trapped under debris in remote rural counties. 

The death toll from the 7.0-magnitude earthquake had risen to 193, up from 157 on Saturday night, with more than 10,574 people injured, as of 10.30 am (8 am IST) on Sunday, said the Department of Civil Affairs of Sichuan province. 

The earthquake struck the city of Ya’an, home to 1.5 million residents, in the Lushan county, located around 140 km from the provincial capital Chengdu. The impact of the earthquake was strong enough to rattle buildings in Chengdu and to be felt in as many as five surrounding provinces, with landslides reported in Yunnan province and at least one death reported in neighbouring Shaanxi. 

The remote location of the counties and landslides in the region have slowed down rescue and recovery work, with rescuers only managing to reach Baoxing on Sunday morning, a full 24 hours after the earthquake struck. 

The China Earthquake Administration (CEA) said on Sunday that as many as 1,097 aftershocks had been recorded, with three of them greater than 5.0-magnitude. 

Saturday’s earthquake struck parts of Sichuan that were still struggling to recover from a devastating earthquake in 2008 that left at least 90,000 people dead or missing. The CEA said the earthquake originated in the earthquake-prone Longmenshan fracture zone, where 12 major earthquakes of at least 5.0-magnitude have been recorded since 1900. Saturday’s earthquake, the CEA said, was “not expected to be as disastrous” as the 2008 earthquake
