LUSHAN, China (Reuters) – Hundreds of survivors of a 6.6 magnitude earthquake that hit southwest China, killing nearly 200 people, pushed into traffic along a main road on Monday, waving protest signs, demanding help and shouting at police.

China has poured resources into Sichuan since the early Saturday quake, including 1 billion yuan (106 million pounds) from central coffers for disaster relief and compensation. About 18,000 troops are in the area.

The earthquake killed at least 186 people and injured more than 11,000, state media said.

But while many have praised the government for its swift response, growing anger among some underscores the government’s challenge, magnified by the fact that Sichuan bore the brunt of a 7.9 earthquake in 2008 that killed nearly 70,000 people.

The damage to listed businesses in the area appeared limited. Toll road operator Sichuan Expressway said none of its roads were damaged, while motor-maker Dongfeng Electric said the quake did not cause any losses.
