Earthquake claims 156 lives, injures thousands in China | News | DW.DE | 20.04.2013 

Scores were killed and thousands injured on Saturday when a 6.6 magnitude earthquake hit China’s southwestern Sichuan province. Rescuers were brought in immediately to help uncover survivors trapped in the rubble.

China’s worst earthquake in three years struck at 8:02 a.m. local time on Sunday in Lushan county near Ya’an city, killing 156 people and injuring at least 5,500.

“The current most urgent issue is grasping the first 24 hours since the quake’s occurrence, the golden time for saving lives,” Xinhua quoted Li as saying.

Li arrived in the quake zone by helicopter and helped organize rescue efforts from a plaza in Longmen township in Lushan, Xinhua reported. The square outside the Lushan County Hospital was turned into a triage center.

According to a state television report, nearly all the low-rise housing and buildings in villages near the epicenter collapsed in the earthquake.

The same region was struck by a larger earthquake in 2008, which killed 70,000.
