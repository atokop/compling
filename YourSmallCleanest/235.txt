Aid and rescue teams have battled landslides and more than 2,000 aftershocks in an effort to find survivors and get basic needs into remote areas of China's earthquake-ravaged Sichuan province.Clogged roads and debris impeded rescuers on Monday as they travelled often on foot in the mountainous southwest region after a 6.6-magnitude quake left at least 188 dead.Saturday's earthquake left many people missing and more than 11,000 injured, according to state media. Local authorities said around 17,000 families had lost their homes.

MacRae said that Save the Children teams, many of whom responded to the 2008 Sichuan earthquake disaster, and government troops had managed to bring in supplies on foot to some remote areas by Sunday night.

Villagers along the outer edge of the earthquake zone complained to Al Jazeera that they had received almost no government help despite the massive relief effort taking place.

In 2008, the outlying areas escaped the worst of the damage, so residents said buildings were not reinforced and that made them more prone to damage in this latest quake.

Earthquake survivors in Tianquan County said they were in urgent need of tents as more rain was expected in the region.

The disaster comes five years after a quake in Sichuan struck 200km from Lushan. It left 90,000 people dead or missing.

The 2008 earthquake triggered an outpouring of public anger after the discovery that schools collapsed while other buildings did not, creating suspicions of corruption and shoddy construction.

Despite of complaints over the latest quake, the response on China's Twitter-like "weibo" websites to Saturday's disaster has overwhelmingly been one of support for the government's efforts.
