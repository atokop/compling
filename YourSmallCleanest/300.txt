Earthquake in Sichuan: Charity Organization Has China Seeing Red - Wall Street Journal - WSJ.com

Various parts of China’s state machinery sprang into action with impressive speed on Saturday after a strong earthquake hit southwestern Sichuan only 50 miles from the epicenter of the massive temblor that devastated the region in 2008. Efforts by the media and the military so far seem to have earned approval from the country’s online commentariat, who remember well how the government struggled under similar circumstances five years ago.

The scandal was made worse by persistent questions over the whereabouts of billions of yuan in donations for victims of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, a significant chunk of which was managed by the Chinese Red Cross, and did lasting damage to charity fund-raising efforts in a country already short on trust.

In the same way the current H7N9 bird flu outbreak has given Chinese authorities a chance to atone for its mishandling of SARS a decade ago, Saturday’s earthquake provides the Chinese Red Cross with an opportunity to win back some of the trust it has lost in recent years. Though if the tenor of the response online is any indication, they’ll have much less money to work with this time around.
