BEIJING, April 23 (Xinhua) -- China's official charity bodies, beset by a trust crisis, should seize the latest earthquake in Sichuan Province as a chance to rebuild a reputation damaged by earlier scandals of corruption.

The Red Cross Society of China (RCSC), a leading figure in the pool, has become a target for public criticism on the Internet since the beginning of the 7.0-magnitude earthquake that hit Sichuan on Saturday, the exact province ravaged by a much deadlier quake five years ago.

Public hostility toward the RCSC and other government-sponsored charities in general has mounted over the years, particularly since the massive 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, after a series of scandals pointed to cheating in the allocation of donations and corruption among their employees.

Now that the public is keeping a skeptical eye on the RCSC during the new earthquake, which has killed nearly 200 people so far, it offers a precious chance for the organization to prove itself.

Fortunately, despite some public apathy, the RCSC says on its official website it had received more than 120 million yuan (19.4 million U.S. dollars) worth of public donations for the Saturday earthquake as of Monday afternoon.

Currently, the organization has made some progress by stating on its website the amount of money each donor has made to help with rescue and reconstruction work related to the earthquake.
