 Rescuers are hunting for survivors after an earthquake strikes rural China, killing more than 150 people and injuring thousands.

A strong 6.6 magnitude earthquake has hit China’s Sichuan province, the epicenter is close to where a major earthquake killed almost 70,000 people in 2008.

Saturday morning’s earthquake triggered landslides and disrupted phone and power connections in mountainous Lushan county. The village of Longmen was hit particularly hard, with authorities saying nearly all the buildings there had been destroyed in a frightening minute-long shaking.

In nearby Ya’an town, where aftershocks could be felt nearly 20 hours after the quake, residents sat in groups outside convenience stores watching the news on television sets.

“The current most urgent issue is grasping the first 24 hours since the quake’s occurrence, the golden time for saving lives,” Xinhua news agency quoted Mr Li as saying.
