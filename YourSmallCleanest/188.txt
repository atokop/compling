Thousands have been injured and more than 150 killed by a 6.6-magnitude earthquake in China's Sichuan province.

The quake struck at 08:00, and flattened villages near the epicentre.

New Premier Li Keqiang (sitting, left) flew to Sichuan, saying the first 24 hours after a quake was the "golden time" for saving lives.

The government was heavily criticised for its response to the last major earthquake in Sichuan in 2008. This time their rescue efforts have been hampered by powerful aftershocks, landslides and blocked roads.
