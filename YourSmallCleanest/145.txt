7.0 magnitude quake hits China, 156 killed, 5500 injured

	At least 156 people were killed and more than 5,500 injured when a devastating 7.0-magnitude earthquake rocked southwest China's Sichuan province today, flattening more than 10,000 homes in a seismic mountainous region that suffered a catastrophic quake in 2008.

	The quake struck the province on the edge of the Tibetan Plateau at 8:02 am, prompting a major relief and rescue operation in the same area where 90,000 people were reported dead or missing in a 8-magnitude quake in 2008.

	Twelve hours after the quake hit Lushan county in the city of Ya'an, the China Earthquake Administration said at least 156 people had been confirmed dead with over 5,500 injured.

	The epicentre of the earthquake was reported to be at a depth of 13 km and was monitored at 30.3 degrees north latitude and 103.0 degrees east longitude.

	The powerful quake flattened buildings, triggered landslides and disrupted phone and power connections in the historic Lushan county, home of endangered giant Pandas on the foot hills of Tibetan plateau.

	Though a notch less, Chinese earthquake experts said today's quake caused massive destruction as it was a shallow one taking place just below 13 km down the earth, putting a lot of punch in its tremors.

	Adapt at dealing with massive earthquakes with skills acquired from both 2008 Sichuan and 2010 Qinghai quakes, China mobilised thousands of rescuers including over 2,500 army troops from provincial capital Chengdu which also felt the tremors in the morning.

	The quake also tested the coordination skills of China's new leaders.

	While President Xi Jinping ordered troops in the quake-hit zone to make "every possible effort" to rescue, Premier Li Keqiang flew to Ya'an city hours after the earthquake where he personally began coordinating rescue efforts.

	"The current most urgent issue is grasping the first 24 hours after the quake's occurrence, the golden time for saving lives, to take scientific rescue measures and save peoples' lives," Li said.
