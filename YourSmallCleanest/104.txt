A powerful earthquake in south-west China has killed more than 100 people and left hundreds more injured.

The 6.6-magnitude quake struck rural areas of Sichuan province early on Saturday.

Sichuan was devastated by an earthquake in 2008. Tens of thousands of people died and 5 million were left homeless.
