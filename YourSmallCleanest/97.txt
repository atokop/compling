At least 2 dead after 6.9 earthquake hits southwestern China

HONG KONG (CNN) — A strong earthquake struck the southwestern Chinese province of Sichuan on Saturday, killing at least two people and shaking buildings throughout the surrounding region.

The quake struck just after 8 a.m. local time about 115 kilometers (70 miles) away from the city of Chengdu at a depth of around 12 kilometers, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. There was conflicting information about the earthquake’s strength, with the USGS putting the magnitude at 6.6 and the China Earthquake Networks Center gauging it at 7.0.

At least two people have been confirmed dead as a result of the quake, the state-run news agency Xinhua reported, citing local authorities. Photos circulating on social media suggested the quake may have caused considerable damage to buildings.
