Rescuers carrying an elderly person from a collapsed building after a 7-magnitude quake hit Lushan last Saturday.

“I realised immediately it was an earthquake,” Ms Chen, 23, said in Lushan county, Yaan city, in Sichuan province.

“I (survived) the earthquake five years ago,” she said, referring to a devastating quake in Sichuan that left about 87,000 people dead or missing on May 12, 2008.

The 7-magnitude earthquake hit Yaan city in south-western Sichuan province last Saturday morning.

Yesterday, the toll of the dead and missing from the country’s worst earthquake in three years climbed to 208, with almost 1,000 seriously injured. At press time, the Ministry of Civil Affairs put the number of dead at 184 and missing at 24.

Premier Li Keqiang and other officials, including Vice-Premier Wang Yang, flew to the disaster zone five hours after the earthquake and arrived at Lushan to oversee rescue efforts.
