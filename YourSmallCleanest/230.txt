PRESIDENT Jakaya Kikwete on Sunday sent a message of condolences to his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, following deaths of 208 people in the Asian country's worst earthquake in three years that also left over 1,000 injured.

The 6.6 magnitude quake struck in Lushan county, near the city of Ya'an in the southwestern province of Sichuan, close to where a devastating 7.9 quake hit in May 2008, killing 70,000. In his message through the Chinese Embassy in Dar es Salaam on Saturday, President Kikwete said he was deeply saddened by the news of the devastating earthquake that hit the Lushan County.

In Ya'an, relief workers from across China expressed frustration with gaining access to Lushan and the villages beyond, up in the mountains. "We're in a hurry. There are people that need help and we have supplies in the back (of the car)," said one man from the Shandong Province Earthquake Emergency Response Team, who declined to give his name.
