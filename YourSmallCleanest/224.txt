Lushan: Tens of thousands of homeless survivors of China’s devastating quake are living in makeshift tents or on the streets, facing shortages of food and supplies as well as an uncertain future.

Others though said they counted themselves fortunate, as while they had lost their homes, their loved ones survived the quake and a terrifying succession of some 3,000 aftershocks.

Thousands of volunteers have rushed to the region from across China but have now been told to avoid the quake-stricken area, after being blamed for traffic congestion that has also disrupted rescue efforts.

Chinese media have given blanket coverage to the aftermath of the 6.6 magnitude tremor, which struck close to the epicentre of an enormous 2008 quake that left 90,000 dead or missing.
