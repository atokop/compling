LUSHAN, April 21 (Xinhua) -- A devastating earthquake that shook southwest China's Sichuan Province Saturday has killed 181 people and injured more than 10,000 as of midday Sunday.

The 7.0-magnitude quake jolted Lushan County of Ya'an, a city near the provincial capital Chengdu, at 8:02 a.m. Saturday Beijing Time.

Rescuers are racing against time to save lives, hoping to take full advantage of the first 72 hours after the quake, a period in which survivors are still likely to be found.

Here are some snapshots from the quake sites.

Zou Guangqin, 56, is a peasant woman from Yingjing, a county of Ya'an City which was also affected by the quake.

The highway that passes her village in Datianba Township and links to Tianquan County was packed with vehicles, including trucks carrying rescuers and relief supplies, cars carrying reporters and local residents eager to go home to the quake zones.
