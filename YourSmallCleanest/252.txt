Earthquake: President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang pledge to put full resources of the State into search-and-rescue mission after the people of the province face new tragedy. 

"I realized immediately it was an earthquake," Chen, 23, said in Lushan county, Ya'an, in Sichuan province. 

"I went through the earthquake five years ago," she said, referring to the devastating quake that left about 87,000 people dead or missing on May 12, 2008. The epicenter - Wenchuan county - is about 200 kilometers from Ya'an. "It was like living through the nightmare again, only worse." 

The magnitude-7 earthquake hit Ya'an city in Southwest China's Sichuan province on Saturday morning. 

The earthquake occurred at 8:02 am with Lushan county, the epicenter, hit hardest. 

The quake struck at a depth of only 13 km, according to the China Earthquake Administration. 

Premier Li Keqiang and other officials, including Vice-Premier Wang Yang, flew to the disaster zone five hours after the earthquake and arrived at Lushan to oversee rescue efforts. 

Song Gang, a Sichuan resident who was traveling in Ya'an when the quake hit, bought 500 bottles of water and 200 boxes of instant noodles and rushed to Lushan county. 

"Currently, the most urgent issue is to save people. We cannot waste a single second in the first 72 hours after the quake, which is the peak time for saving lives," he said. 

"First we have to rescue the trapped from the debris and then check the quake-hit buildings, one by one," Li said. 

Li urged officials to ensure that quake victims have accommodation, food and safe drinking water. Li also promised to release information about the quake efficiently to dispel possible public concern.
