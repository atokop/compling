The strong earthquake that struck Sichuan on Saturday was one of the first major natural disasters in the age of widespread social media adoption in China.

Users of China’s popular microblogs might be expected to grumble about the government response to the quake, but thus far the reaction has been generally positive. Instead, many users of Sina Corp.’s microblog platform, Weibo, have focused their attention on comparing charitable donations from major organizations.

In particular, some users griped about the donations of local companies like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd.  Both companies originally said they had donated 5 million yuan to the quake effort. They also both worked to make use of their powerful social media functions to help people affected by the quake get in touch with loved ones, or report where help was needed.

Five years ago, when an even deadlier quake hit Sichuan, a number of foreign companies were criticized for not donating enough, according to APCO Worldwide Senior Counselor James McGregor. Though  Mr. McGregor said that donations from foreign companies was well-meant to help victims, he also pointed out that, “if you’re a foreign company in China these days, you’re an open target for both attacks form people on the Internet and also government entities and the government media, so I think the default is always to anticipate that you’ll have trouble and try to get ahead of it.”

Though the government is likely to continues to keep a tight leash on social media, the many positive uses of social media during the earthquake could potentially spur more government support for online engagement in charity, according to Mr. McGregor.
