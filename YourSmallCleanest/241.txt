A total of 188 people were dead and 11,460 were missing as of press time on Monday, two days after a powerful earthquake hit Ya'an city in Southwest China's Sichuan province, according to China Central Television. 

The magnitude-7 earthquake hit the city at 8:02 am on Saturday. 

China's Premier Li Keqiang climbed onto a heap of debris to view the disaster area after arriving in Lushan county, Sichuan province, where he expressed condolences to victims and survivors of the devastating earthquake. 

Li flew to Lushan shortly after the earthquake struck and visited temporary settlements, hospitals and tents. 

Li also visited Yang Yujie, a 7-year-old boy whose mother and elder sister remained missing after their home was ruined in the quake. The boy's father was hurrying home from his job in another city. 

As of 6 pm on Sunday, West China Hospital had received and treated 213 quake victims.
