    		BEIJING - Nearly 30 people were killed and at least 400 injured in a strong earthquake in the southwestern China province of Sichuan, state media said Saturday.      

      	     More than 2,000 soldiers were rushing to the area for rescue and relief work as authorities feared growing casualty tolls, the official Xinhua news agency said.     The China Earthquake Networks Center said a magnitude-7.0 earthquake hit Lushan county of Ya'an municipality at 8:02 a.m.     The U.S. Geological Survey revised the quake's intensity to magnitude-6.6 from an initially reported 6.9 magnitude. It was centered west of Linqiong city.     A magnitude-8.0 quake in the quake-prone region in May 2008 killed nearly 90,000 people.
