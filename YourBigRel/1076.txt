Text messaging and data connections did not seem to be affected to the same degree.It was unclear if the network issues were a result of an overload of people using the network to make calls, or if any cellular towers were damaged in the earthquake.“We are seeing no reports of damage to our wireless network, which is built for reliability in situations like this,” said Tom Pica, a spokesman for Verizon Wireless. Mr. Pica said the network experienced “congestion in parts of the East for a short time after the tremors.”An AT&T spokeswoman said in an e-mail message: “We have no reports of network damage but we are seeing heavy call volumes.” T-Mobile said on Twitter: “T-Mobile’s network is experiencing higher call volumes in all areas affected by the earthquake. We advise customers to use SMS or e-mail.”Crystal Davis, a spokeswoman for Sprint, said in an e-mail message, “Customers did experience a slight delay in making and receiving calls in the hour or two immediately following the earthquake.” Ms. Davis said traffic on the network quickly returned to normal.“The industry’s infrastructure appears to be intact, but because many wireless consumers are using the networks, we are experiencing higher than normal traffic,” explained Amy Storey, a spokeswoman for CTIA, the wireless industry association. Ms. Storey said customers should try to use text messaging and avoid phone calls, which can saturate a network.There were hundreds of comments on Twitter from people in Virginia and New York noting that cellphone service was intermittent or completely unavailable.
