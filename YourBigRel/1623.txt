		Virginia Stations Roll After Quake's Shakes	
Yesterday afternoon’s unusual earthquake had stations near its epicenter mobilizing all their resources to tell viewers in Richmond, Lynchburg and Charlottesville what was happening through cut-ins and wall-to-wall coverage.

Within minutes of Tuesday’s Virginia earthquake, TV stations near the temblor’s epicenter went live with coverage letting viewers know what had rocked their world.
Rattled a bit themselves, news crews in markets like Richmond (DMA 57), Lynchburg (DMA 66) and Charlottesville (DMA 183) broke away from network programming with either wall-to-wall or live cut-in quake coverage.

Story continues after the ad



 

Although damage from the 5.8 magnitude earthquake — which hit near Mineral at 1:51 p.m. and was felt along the East Coast — was minimal, the unexpected seismic event sent shock waves through the area.
“I walked in the door right after it happened and it has been crazy ever since,” Celeste Wright, a producer at WVIR, Waterman Broadcasting’s NBC affiliate in Charlottesville, said Tuesday night.  “We tried to do as much as we could.”
For WVIR, that meant deploying reporters to places from Mineral to Charlottesville’s streets, feeding content to a station anchor and meteorologist who did cut-ins all afternoon, Wright said.
WVIR’s team was in good company as the earthquake — which evacuated some newsrooms – sent crews scrambling to get information to viewers who wanted it fast and furiously.
At WTVR, Local TV’s CBS affiliate in Richmond, station employees from sales reps to support staff pitched in, while the station went wall-to-wall with earthquake coverage from about 2:30 to 6:30 p.m., according to Travis Ponton, a photojournalist and assignment desk editor.
WTVR, like other stations in the area, relied heavily on viewers’ Facebook and Twitter posts to learn how neighborhoods and residents were affected by the quake. The station aired video from its newsroom security camera to show the temblor in action.
“You have to think outside the box,” Ponton said, adding that the newsroom was moving at “a million miles an hour.”
From a newsperson’s perspective, the quake happened at a particularly opportune time, as its mid-afternoon strike meant there were plenty of people out and about to share their stories, said Jim Hanchett, news director of WCAV, Gray’s CBS affiliate in Charlottesville.
After briefly evacuating the building, Hanchett, who doubles as an anchor, went on-air for wall-to-wall coverage, with a range of rapidly produced reports. Those included interviews with the station’s mail carrier and residents who came out of their nearby homes.
A reporter out for lunch at the time was able to get the security tape from a nearby supermarket. Another covered the quake from a local elementary school, where the reporter was supposed to be doing a story on today’s start of the school year.
“I think the key thing for us was reacting quickly and getting as many cameras going as quickly as we could,” Hanchett said, adding that the station’s full news team mobilized just as one would hope they would.
“Everyone either stayed late from the morning shift or came in early for the evening,” he said.
Although cell phone coverage was briefly interrupted, station heads said they managed to work around the temporary problem, and that stations stayed on air despite the rattling and rolling.
However, the experience showed that TV stations — and a mix of social media and good old-fashioned landline phones — play an important role when the unexpected rolls through town.
Randy Smith, president of WSET, the Allbritton ABC affiliate in Lynchburg, said the station’s chief meteorologist (who apparently didn’t expect to use his Earth science education as a weathercaster in Virginia) sent out a Tweet confirming the quake just two minutes after it hit.
The stations' phone lines went wild as well. “Our switchboard was absolutely jammed for perhaps the first 40 minutes after the earthquake,” Smith said.

                                    In a 'never let a disaster go to waste' moment, Jay Rockefeller is using the VA quake to push his spectrum auction bill with the CTIA claiming that there was cellphone congestion.  But as this article shows, broadcast TV was right there providing emergency information in a way that no cellphone alert system could.  Of course, we out in California are asking, "5.8?  What's the big deal?"

					Joe Flint				

For many, the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks will be a time for sober and solemn reflection. But for FX's Rescue Me, those words have never been part of the equation. The drama, which centers on a crew of battle-scarred New York City  firefighters who try to get past the tragedy with a mix of black humor  and bad choices, ends its seven-season run next Wednesday (Sept. 7)  the same way it  arrived: loud and unforgiving. 



					Mike Hale				

Normally, Dark Matters:  Twisted but True, a cornball documentary series on the Science Channel that tells unsavory stories of scientific  research, wouldn't merit much attention. It's a standard show of its  kind, relating urban legends, conspiracy theories and sensational  more-or-less-true stories with the help of cheap special effects and  hilariously cheesy re-creations. But Dark Matters will get noticed because of the man hired to play the role of sonorous narrator: John Noble, the  Australian actor who has attracted a particularly fanatical cult  following for his dual parts on the Fox science-fiction series Fringe.  It's a no-brainer: a fictional mad scientist hosting a show that's at  least partly about real mad scientists. 



					Hank Stuever				

Sundance Channel’s well-meaning but unsettling new series Quirky is meant to celebrate innovation and entrepreneurial can-do spirit. Instead, it eerily reflects the vapidity of the American economy and employment  picture, where ideas trump labor and success is measured by top-level  paydays instead of actual toil. Hipsters invent, while Chinese labor  manufactures and shoppers mindlessly buy. 



					Alessandra Stanley				

The Hour, a new BBC America series, is a thriller  that blends the Suez crisis in Britain with a more intimate look at sex,  ambition and espionage in the workplace, around 1956. Any period piece set in the 1950s is bound to look a lot like Mad Men,  and this narrative also unfolds through an amber haze of cigarette  smoke, whiskey and social taboos. Yet unlike the many sterile Mad Men knockoffs that American networks are bringing out in the fall, this BBC series isn't a pale imitation of  anything else on television. The Hour is so good that it seems far too short, and that makes its six-episode arc just right. 



					Mary McNamara				

In a bit of unintentional synchronicity, the HBO documentary on feminist icon Gloria Steinem Gloria: In Her Own Words airs mere weeks before NBC trots out period soap The Playboy Club. It's difficult to imagine that her voice retains enough resonance to  affect ratings — at 77, she is perceived by many to be as much of a  historical curiosity piece as Hugh Hefner. Which is why Gloria: In Her Own Words, though not perfect, is such an important documentary. 







					Matt Zoller Seitz On Why TV News Is Addicted To Weather Porn				

When it comes to storms, TV news sticks to the script — no matter how cynical, exploitative or cliched it may be. 



					Aaron Barnhart On Reality TV And Rural America				

Rural America has an image problem. It's especially bad among younger  people, who have spent the past decade consuming stilted, farcical  images of country folk that TV executives regularly recycle for their  entertainment. 



					Marc Berman Remembers Sherwood Schwartz				

As comedies come and go (and come. And go.) what set Gilligan’s Island and The Brady Bunch apart was the simplicity of the stories, the warm reliability of the  jokes: Jan failing at everything (“Marcia, Marcia, Marcia!"),  and  Gilligan hanging out with the Skipper (“Little Buddy”) are small screen  situations etched in our mind forever thanks to Schwartz. Any book on  the history of television deserves to have a chapter devoted entirely to  Sherwood Schwartz. 



					Tim Goodman On Why TNT Should Renew 'Men Of A Certain Age'				

It seems clear that TNT is on the fence about renewing Men and looking,  perhaps optimistically, at Thursday's Emmy nominations before making a  move. But TNT shouldn't feel the fate of Men rests with the Emmys. That's like trusting your kid with a crazy person. Instead, this is a time to go with your gut. And I've got to believe that TNT knows already that Men is a gem. It's a distinctive and important award that comes with a  subtle suggestion. And that is: please don't kill this show even  though it's not a hit. Please think beyond the numbers and, if you can,  beyond the money. 



					Len Grace On Retransmission Consent				

Retransmission consent negotiations continue to be in the news as broadcasters and pay-tv operators square-off to present their cases to the FCC why current rules should stay as they are, or be revamped to consider  current economics and market conditions that create opposite interests,  and therefore threaten to disrupt consumer access to high-profile  programming at the most critical times. If you ask me, this is nonsense  of scale. Nonsense, in reference to how this has been allowed to  proliferate in the market, and scale, referring to the size and scope of  the problem.

There are 50.5 million Hispanics in the U.S., 15 million more than 10  years ago; they now make up 16% of the total U.S. population.  That means vast and growing economic power, with Hispanics expected to  spend $1.2 trillion in 2012. Incredibly, the general media and advertising market has been in a  state of denial about this fundamental and transformational demographic  shift. And it's not like it hasn't had time to digest it: it's been  trending this way for some 30 years. (Adweek) 



					Rebecca Eaton: 25 Years Mastering 'Masterpiece'				

With a name like Masterpiece, it has to be good. For a quarter-century, Rebecca Eaton has overseen  this weekly British drama showcase on PBS whose reputation for excellence is  undisputed. But now, with Masterpiece marking its 40th year (it  first aired in January 1971), the pressures of maintaining that  masterpiece tradition might have reasonably begun to wear on the person  in charge. "It's my life's work," declares Eaton, looking anything but pressured, "and I love it." (AP)
