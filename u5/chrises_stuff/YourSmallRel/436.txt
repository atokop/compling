Earthquake in Sikkim
			Hi friends,
I was looking for a thread on this topic but didn't find any. So decided to create one.
How many of you experienced yesterday's tremors? Do share your views about it.
As for me, I was in my hometown Siliguri when the quake took place. I was watching the movie "Mere Brother Ki Dulhan" when suddenly the ceiling started falling. Luckily, I managed to get out unharmed. 
I've shared the detailed experience at my blog: Sikkim Earthquake: A Personal Experience | Techrav 
Tomorrow I'll be leaving for Sikkim as I need to join back my college. Didn't even get a full day holiday today 
Anyways, lets just pray for all the victims of the aftermath !

			Terrible. I didn't feel any shake here anyway.
Just hope they recover quickly and no more damage done.

Re: Earthquake in Sikkim
			
			It was shaking like the land liquified here in ktm, Land shaking in vertical and horizontal in two directions all at once was a hell of an experience. It almost felt like my house was floating.

Felt a mild shaking while lying on the bed (I know that's un-usual at that time but everybody know what friends can do to anyone. :sick: ).

Its not sad that people lost their lives.. Even more sad is thinking what will happen to their families and relatives...
