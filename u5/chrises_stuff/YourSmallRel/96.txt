ORIGINAL POST BELOW
An earthquake measuring 6.9 on the Richter scale (initially reported by local news as 5.9 and by USGS as 7.0) hit Sichuan this morning at 8:02 a.m.
The quake's epicenter was near Ya'an (longitude 30.1, latitude 103.0, depth 13km) and was followed minutes later by at least one aftershock.
On the ground in Chengdu 120km away from the epicenter, the quake felt powerful, and residents are gathering around outside. The memory of the tragic May 2008 Wenchuan quake, which left tens of thousands dead or missing, is still fresh in their minds.
Mobile networks were momentarily down but already seem to be working again.
