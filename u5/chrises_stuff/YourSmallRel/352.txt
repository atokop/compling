Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief Nitin Gadkari Sunday expressed concern on the earthquake that hit several parts of the country.
Gandhi, who expressed "deep concern and anxiety", has urged authorities and the disaster management system to remain vigilant and extend all help to the affected areas, the Congress said in a statement.
Gadkari also expressed solidarity with the people affected by the quake in the northeastern region of the country.
At least 14 people were killed and at least 150 injured Sunday as a 6.8 intensity earthquake ravaged the Sikkim-Nepal border region, jolting large parts of India, Bangladesh and Nepal and causing widespread panic.
