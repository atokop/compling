BEIJING, April 22 (Xinhua) -- President Xi Jinping on Monday said relief work in quake-hit southwest China is being carried out efficiently and Chinese people can overcome difficulties caused by the disaster.
Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the government, and with the support from the international community, Chinese people are able to rebuild their homes, Xi said.
A 7.0-magnitude earthquake jolted southwest China's Sichuan Province on Saturday morning, killing at least 188 people and affecting about 1.5 million people.
The earthquake, which caused serious casualties and property losses, has concerned every Chinese person, Xi said.
The CPC Central Committee, the State Council and Central Military Commission mobilized the military and civilian forces to engage in rescue and relief work shortly after the quake, he said.
"The relief work is happening efficiently and orderly," he said.
He expressed gratitude towards the international community for their concern and support.
The international community has expressed sympathy and support for the Chinese government and people, which displayed goodwill and raised the morale of Chinese citizens, he said.
Xi made the statement when receiving credentials presented by new ambassadors from nine foreign countries.
The ambassadors are Masood Khalid from Pakistan, Ernest M. Makawa from Malawi, Farid Abboud from Lebanon, Omer Eisa Ahmed from Sudan, Eva Fundafunda from Zambia, Salaheddin M.I. Elbishari from Libya, Erlinda F. Basilio from the Philippines, Manuel Valencia from Spain and Jorge Torres-Pereira from Portugal.
They said their thoughts and concerns were with the Chinese people and expressed their belief that the Chinese government and people will overcome the difficulties caused by the disaster.
They also expressed their willingness to help.
