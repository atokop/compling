The human element





The human elementfrom Web Edition | Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists by Hugh GustersonThe  discussions about the safety of nuclear reactors in the new  post-Fukushima world have focused on technical questions: Is it possible  to make reactors earthquake-proof? What is the best way to ensure that  spent fuel remains safe? What is the optimal design for coolant systems?  Can reactors be made "inherently safe"?

PLYMOUTH, Mass. 
Federal nuclear regulators have issued a critical report  following the unplanned shutdown of a Massachusetts nuclear power plant  in May.
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission in a report released Thursday  criticized Pilgrim's owners for inadequate training and enforcement of  its standards following the automatic shutdown, which occurred as the  reactor was being returned to service after a refueling and maintenance  outage.
The shutdown was blamed on human error.

BNC Civil disorder and nuclear power






      Civil disorder and nuclear power  Barry Brook | 4 September 2011 at 10:15 PM | Categories: Nuclear  | URL: http://wp.me/piCIJ-1ir  
 Nuclear  fission, like any other energy source, carries benefits and risks. In  discussion on future deployment of different sustainable energy sources,  the commentary in this blog has placed a lot of emphasis on the  rational weighting of factors such as: (i) lives lost per unit of energy  delivered; (ii) costs expended and opportunity losses; (iii)  reliability and stability for electricity provision, including essential  services; (iv) risks of catastrophic failure of technologies (e.g.,  hydro dam burst, nuclear meltdown, fossil fuel explosions, super-volcano  wipeout of solar capacity, etc.), (v) ability of different technologies  to effectively mitigate anthropogenic global warming and close down fossil-fuel power stations [perhaps the most important single factor]; (vi) security of fissile material; (vii) ...and so on.
However, there is one topic, related to the above, that has never been broached here. I was reminded of this recently by Geoff Russell:
About  the only criticism of nuclear power that still carries any weight with  me is the issue of what happens to a nuclear plant when civil order  breaks down. I envisage something like Toshiba batteries all over remote  areas of the planet or in clusters in not-so-remote areas but want to  know more about what happens to a bunch of such batteries around Kampala  during a coup or civil war. I figured a specific BNC thread on the  issue might be helpful.
The recent riots in the U.K.  -- a small-scale example of civil disorder, shows that such examples of  societal breakdown are not inconceivable. The most likely significant  event is during open warfare, however, as Geoff pointed out. How  vulnerable would current nuclear installations be to an invading army,  for instance? Would they try to destroy them (in order to spread panic  among the populace), or preserve them for the use of the occupying  force? If civil society broke down, who would close down and secure the  nuclear power stations? In the greater scheme of things, would this even  be a  high priority? Are there examples of wars in the last 50 years in  which the invaded nation had nuclear power plants?
I frankly don't have any ready answers. I suspect that some  technologies would be far safer than others in such circumstances -- for  instance the Toshiba 4S batteries that Geoff mentioned would be self-cooling and buried underground. Tom Blees, in Prescription for the Planet, noted the following:

Statement by EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson on the Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards





EPA Press Office (News Media Only)   press@epa.gov 
202-564-4355 

FOR IMMEDIATE RELASE 
September 2, 2011   

 Statement by EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson on the Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards 

Since day one, under President Obama’s leadership, EPA has worked  to ensure health protections for the American people, and has made  tremendous progress to ensure that Clean Air Act standards protect all  Americans by reducing our exposures to harmful air pollution like  mercury, arsenic and carbon dioxide.  This Administration  has put in place some of the most important standards and safeguards for  clean air in U.S. history: the most  significant reduction of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide air  pollution across state borders; a long-overdue proposal to finally cut  mercury pollution from power plants; and the first-ever carbon pollution  standards for cars and trucks.  We will revisit the ozone standard, in compliance with the Clean Air Act.

Statement by the President on the Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards





THE WHITE HOUSE   
Office of the Press Secretary FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   
September 2, 2011   Statement by the President on the Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards   
Over the last two and half years, my administration, under the  leadership of EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson, has taken some of the  strongest actions since the enactment of the Clean Air Act four decades  ago to protect our environment and the health of our families from air  pollution. From reducing mercury and other toxic air pollution from  outdated power plants to doubling the fuel efficiency of our cars and  trucks, the historic steps we’ve taken will save tens of thousands of  lives each year, remove over a billion tons of pollution from our air,  and produce hundreds of billions of dollars in benefits for the American  people.   
At the same time, I have continued to underscore the importance of  reducing regulatory burdens and regulatory uncertainty, particularly as  our economy continues to recover.  With that in mind, and  after careful consideration, I have requested that Administrator Jackson  withdraw the draft Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards at this  time. Work is already underway to update a 2006 review of the science  that will result in the  reconsideration of the ozone standard in 2013.  Ultimately,  I did not support asking state and local governments to begin  implementing a new standard that will soon be reconsidered.   
I want to be clear: my commitment and the commitment of my  administration to protecting public health and the environment is  unwavering. I will continue to stand with the hardworking men and women  at the EPA as they strive every day to hold polluters accountable and  protect our families from harmful pollution.  And my administration will continue to vigorously oppose efforts to weaken EPA’s authority under the Clean Air Act or dismantle  the progress we have made.

UN nuclear agency calls for rare Mideast talks on non-proliferation





UN nuclear agency calls for rare Mideast talks on non-proliferationIsrael, Arab states signal readiness to join talks but Iran says no 'justification' for proposed forum now. Israel is widely assumed to hold the Middle East's only nuclear  arsenal and is also the only country in the region outside the nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Arab states, backed by Iran, say this  poses a threat to peace and stability. They want Israel to subject all  its atomic facilities to IAEA monitoring. 						    
Israel, which has never confirmed or denied  having atom bombs, says it will only join the NPT if there is a  comprehensive Middle East peace. If it signed the pact, Israel would  have to renounce nuclear weaponry

That thought flitted through the mind of North Anna
 nuclear power plant senior operator Jason Russell when the Aug. 23 earthquake began shaking the facility’s control room.At North Anna nuclear plant, reassurances but no final data on quake impact  Within seconds, indicators showed a loss of electricity needed to cool the plant’s two reactors.
“That’s when I knew it was something else,” said Russell, 30, who was  supervising Unit 1 when the largest Virginia earthquake in more than a  century struck.

AEC Chairman Srikumar Banerjee said, “The country's current 100 ton  capacity of reprocessing will be multiplied several times so that the  two in-principle sanctioned 500 megawatt FBRs do not face fuel shortage  in the coming decade.

Top economist warns green jobs 'creation' will undermine recovery







Press Release
Top economist warns green jobs 'creation' will    undermine recovery
London, 2    September: One of the UK's leading energy and environment    economists warns that the government's promise that green energy policies will    create tens of thousands of jobs and stimulate competitive industries is an    illusion.

In his    report The Myth of Green Jobs, published today by the Global Warming    Policy Foundation, Professor Gordon Hughes (University of Edinburgh) dispels    this assumption by finding that

• The government target for generating    electricity from renewable energy sources will involve a capital cost that is    9-10 times the amount required to meet the same demand by relying upon    conventional power plants.

• The extra investment required for    renewable energy - about £120 bln - will be diverted from more productive uses    in the rest of the economy

• Increases in the cost of energy together    with the diversion of investment funds means that many manufacturing firms    will either go bankrupt or relocate.

• It is impossible for the UK to    acquire a long-term comparative advantage in the manufacture of renewable    energy equipment by any combination of policies that are both feasible and    affordable.

• Policies to promote renewable energy could add 0.6-0.7    percentage points per year to core inflation from now to 2020.

• The    cumulative impact of these policies could amount to a loss of 2-3% of    potential GDP for a period of 20 years or more.

"Claims by politicians    and lobbyists that green energy policies will create a few thousand jobs are    not supported by the evidence. In terms of the labour market, the gains for a    small number of actual or potential employees in businesses specialising in    renewable energy has to be weighed against the dismal prospects for a much    larger group of workers producing tradable goods in the rest of the    manufacturing sector," Professor Hughes said.

The full report can be    downloaded here: The Myth of Green    Jobs


About the Author

Dr Gordon Hughes is a    Professor of Economics at the University of Edinburgh. He was a senior adviser    on energy and environmental policy at the World Bank until 2001. He has    advised governments on environmental policies and was responsible for some of    the World Bank’s most important environmental guidelines.

The 2011 Canadian Nuclear Factbook






I am pleased to present you with the 2011 edition of the Canadian Nuclear Factbook, now available online in PDF format<http://www.cna.ca/NUclearFactbook2011.pdf>.  Published since 2004, the Canadian Nuclear Factbook has become a highly  regarded source of information on nuclear technology in Canada and  around the world. Originally meant to provide basic information on  Canada's nuclear power industry, it has since become much broader in  scope. It is now an integral part of the CNA's public outreach and  education strategy.

As part CNA's proactive Five Year Communication's Strategy, we have  redesigned the Factbook to more effectively promote Canada's nuclear  industry beyond its role as a source of safe, clean, and affordable  electricity now and in the future.
These changes include:


*         Complete new design to visually align the Factbook with our  strategy for dialogue, including social media and NUnuclear.ca<http://www.nunuclear.ca/> microsite.

*         Expanded and updated sections on the role of nuclear in science, health, and medicine.

*         Prominent branding as The Canadian Nuclear Factbook.
As in previous years, we are distributing 25,000 copies of the Factbook  free of charge to member companies, parliamentarians, stakeholders,  schools, and individuals in Canada and around the world. Last year alone  we received individual requests for almost 3,000 copies through our  education website.

I hope that you will find this year's Canadian Nuclear Factbook<http://www.cna.ca/NUclearFactbook2011.pdf>  a useful source of information on Canada's nuclear industry, and that  you will share it with your clients, business partners, and general  public.
In case you wish to order additional copies, you can do so free of charge at www.cna.ca/NUclearFactbook.asp
<http://www.cna.ca/NUclearFactbook.asp>. An electronic copy of the Factbook can be found at www.cna.ca/NUclearFactbook2011.pdf<http://www.cna.ca/NUclearFactbook2011.pdf>.
If you have any suggestions, comments, or feedback on this year's  Factbook, please feel free to share them our Manager of Research,  Dietwald Claus, at clausd@cna.caclausd@cna.ca>. The Factbook wouldn't be possible without the active support of you, our members.

And I encourage all of you to please visit to follow us on our social media channels - our "TalkNUclear.ca<http://talknuclear.ca/>" blog, and our Twitter<http://twitter.com/talknuclear> and Facebook<http://www.facebook.com/TalkNuclear>  pages. Visit also our "NU" microsite about the daily benefits of  nuclear technology beyond energy generation, NUnuclear.ca<http://www.nunuclear.ca/>.

Yours sincerely,

Denise Carpenter

Post-Flood Recovery Begins At Fort Calhoun Nuclear Plant






      Post-Flood Recovery Begins At Fort Calhoun Nuclear Plant  Moderator | September 2, 2011 at 4:12 pm | Categories: General  | URL: http://wp.me/p1fSSY-qD  
Water levels at the Fort Calhoun nuclear plant have  finally dropped about two feet from their highest flood stage,  prompting Omaha Public Power District officials to terminate the Unusual  Event they declared on June 6, and setting the stage for post-flood  recovery.
The NRC today issued a Confirmatory Action Letter documenting actions  that the officials have agreed to take prior to restarting the plant,  located about 19 miles north of Omaha, Neb.
The plant was shut down April 9 for a refueling outage, which was  extended due to flooding along the Missouri River. As the floodwaters  have receded, workers at the site have begun removing flood barriers and  an elaborate elevated catwalk used create access from the flooded  parking lot to key buildings.
At a public meeting on July 27, OPPD officials discussed post  flooding recovery actions and agreed not to restart the plant without  NRC approval. Region IV Administrator Elmo E. Collins has said a series  of comprehensive inspections will have to be performed before the agency  clears the plant for restart.

Inspectors check Virginia nuclear plant for earthquake damage






Inspectors check Virginia nuclear plant for earthquake damage The inspection is unusual, said Scott Burnell, a spokesman for NRC.  Such “augmented inspection teams” are dispatched to nuclear plants  “infrequently. If I had to put a number on it I’d say once every couple  of years.” 
During the quake, 36 “scratch plates” at the facility  recorded ground motion in three dimensions, said Richard Zuercher, a  Dominion spokesman. Preliminary analysis of the plates performed by a  seismologist contracted by Dominion showed “the plant may have exceeded  design basis for ground-force acceleration,” Zuercher said. 
The  plant’s reactor containment buildings were built to withstand shaking  equal to 12 percent of the force of gravity. Dominion said on the day of  the quake that the plant would be safe up to a magnitude 6.2   earthquake. But the amount of shaking such a quake produces varies with  distance to the epicenter, depth, and the type of rock the quake occurs  in.

U.S. Priorities for the NPT and Moving Forward





 U.S. Priorities for the NPT and Moving Forward
RemarksMarcie B. Ries
Deputy Assistant Secretary, Bureau of Arms Control, Verification and Compliance High Level Workshop Against Nuclear Tests--From Here to 2015: Meeting the Targets of the NPT Action Plan New York City September 1, 2011
Good  Afternoon. I would like to begin by thanking the EastWest Institute for  their invitation and for their continued dedicated efforts to help  forge collective action from the international community towards a safer  and better world. I’d also like to thank the Permanent Mission of  Kazakhstan for inviting me to speak at this High Level Workshop. It is  an honor to be here and we have much to discuss regarding our priorities  in moving forward, including our efforts to advance the 2010 Nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) Review Conference Action Plan.
I know Ambassador Susan Burk, U.S. Special Representative for Nuclear  Nonproliferation, spoke very aptly at this event last year about the  2010 NPT Final Document and U.S. priorities for the NPT. I will update  you on these priorities and U.S. actions taken to advance them, but  before I do, let me take say a few words about the 2010 NPT Review  Conference.
2010 NPT Review Conference
As Ambassador Burk noted last year, the 2010 NPT Review Conference  succeeded because the vast majority of the Treaty Parties understood  that the Review Conference was an opportunity to strengthen the NPT and  the global nonproliferation regime at a time of great challenge to both.  Most Parties worked diligently and in good faith throughout the  Conference to find common ground. There was widespread agreement that a  balanced, forward-looking agenda covering all three of the NPT’s  supporting pillars -- nonproliferation, disarmament, and peaceful uses  of nuclear energy -- would reinvigorate both the Treaty and the nuclear  nonproliferation regime of which it is the cornerstone.
The Action Plan adopted at the Conference reflects the understanding  that efforts to strengthen the Treaty must be balanced among its  pillars, as well as the need for “mutual responsibility” in its  implementation, which is critical to the continued viability of the NPT  regime. The real test of the RevCon’s success will be how seriously all  the Parties take the agreement they reached and how well they implement  the commitments they made at the RevCon.
I would like to go into some detail on actions in which we have been  engaged involving all three of the NPT pillars, although I will dwell in  more detail on disarmament, the area for which I have responsibility.  Much has been accomplished since the RevCon.
New START Treaty Implementation
As you all know, the New START Treaty entered into force on February 5th  of this year. Implementation of the Treaty is so far going well. It  continues to be a bright spot in the U.S.-Russian relationship. So far,  the process of Treaty implementation has been very pragmatic,  professional, and positive – a continuation of the positive working  relationship we established during the negotiations in Geneva. We are  constantly in communication with our Russian colleagues and the  implementation process has been precise and efficient.
This Treaty responsibly limits the number of strategic nuclear  weapons and launchers that the United States and Russia may deploy. When  the Treaty is fully implemented, it will result in the lowest number of  strategic nuclear warheads deployed by the United States and the  Russian Federation since the 1950s, the first full decade of the nuclear  age.
The United States and Russia have exchanged data, held exhibitions,  and notified each other on the status of our strategic forces. In fact,  we have exchanged more than 1,000 notifications since February. We also  have begun conducting on-site inspections. To date, the United States  has conducted eight on-site inspections in Russia and Russia has  conducted seven in the United States since the period for New START  Treaty inspections began on April 6.
The access and information derived from this Treaty provide important  predictability and stability in the U.S.-Russian nuclear relationship.  Without this access and information, the risks of miscalculations,  misunderstandings, and mistrust would be greater.
Next Steps in U.S.-Russian Reductions
The United States is committed to continuing a step-by-step process,  as outlined by President Obama in Prague in 2009, to reduce the overall  number of nuclear weapons, including the pursuit of a future agreement  with Russia for broad reductions in all categories of nuclear weapons –  strategic, non-strategic, deployed and non-deployed.
We would also like to increase transparency on a reciprocal basis  with Russia. We are in the process of thinking through how this and  other such transparency measures might be implemented. We will consult  with our NATO allies and invite Russia to join with us to develop an  initiative, including examination of potential reciprocal actions that  could be taken in parallel by the United States and Russia.
We have a lot of very complicated issues to consider, so the more  creative and innovative ideas we have to work with, the better off we  will be. For that reason, we are grateful to the community of experts,  both government and nongovernment, American, Russian, and international,  who are contributing to our work.
While the United States and Russia have more steps to pursue  bilaterally, it is also time to continue, with greater intensity, a  multilateral dialogue among the P5. In late June at a conference in  Paris, the P5 discussed transparency, verification, and  confidence-building measures. The conference, a follow-on to the first  such meeting held in London in 2009, was another constructive step in  the process of nuclear-weapons states’ engagement on disarmament and  related issues, and demonstrated the P5’s commitment to the  implementation of the Action Plan that was adopted by consensus at the  2010 NPT Review Conference.
All the P5 states recognized the fundamental importance of  transparency in building mutual understanding and confidence. We  exchanged information on nuclear doctrine and capabilities and discussed  possible voluntary transparency and confidence-building measures. To  this end, we approved the creation of a working group on Nuclear  Definitions and Terminology. We will also hold technical consultations  on verification issues later this year in London. In order to ensure  that these conferences evolve into a regular process of P5 dialogue, we  agreed to hold a third conference in the context of the 2012 NPT  Preparatory Committee to continue our discussions.
The United States is proud to be at the leading edge of transparency  efforts – publically declaring our nuclear stockpile numbers;  participating in voluntary and treaty-based inspections measures; and  working with other nations on military to military, scientific and lab  exchanges, and site visits.
We hope that all countries will join in the common effort to increase  transparency and build mutual confidence. Confidence-building, at its  very core, is a shared effort.
Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty 
The United States is committed to pursuing U.S. ratification of the  Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) and to its entry into force  at the earliest possible date. Entry into force of the CTBT is an  essential step toward the peace and security of a world without nuclear  weapons. While the United States abides by the core prohibition of the  CTBT through our nuclear testing moratorium promulgated in 1992, the  principal benefit of the Treaty -- that of constraining all states from  testing -- still eludes us.
We have begun a deliberate and methodical process of engaging the  U.S. Senate and the American public on the importance of the CTBT. Entry  into force of the CTBT is an essential step toward the peace and  security of a world without nuclear weapons, a vision articulated by the  President when he spoke in Prague in 2009. Our recent experience  working with the U.S. Senate to gain ratification of the New Strategic  Arms Reduction Treaty – New START – with the Russian Federation has  prepared us for what is expected to be an equally thorough and robust  debate over the CTBT. We do not expect it will be easy or happen  quickly, but we will work hard to make it happen.
The Administration commissioned a number of reports, including an  updated National Intelligence Estimate and an independent National  Academy of Sciences report to assess the ability of the United States to  monitor compliance with the Treaty and the ability of the United States  to maintain, in the absence of nuclear explosive testing, a safe,  secure and effective nuclear arsenal so long as these weapons exist. A  public version of the Academy’s report is expected to be released soon.  These authoritative reports, together with others, will give the U.S.  Senate a wealth of information to assist them in making a determination  on the merits of ratification of the CTBT.
Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty
A Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty continues to be a top priority for  the United States and a large majority of other countries. Negotiating  an FMCT would be a major international achievement for nonproliferation  and for disarmament. So it is disappointing that the Conference on  Disarmament has been unable to achieve consensus to commence  negotiations. Because of this continuing stalemate the P5 agreed to  renew their efforts to promote such negotiations prior to the upcoming  UNGA. Acting on that commitment, the P5 met this week in Geneva, to take  stock of developments regarding the Conference on Disarmament (CD).  They discussed how to achieve at the earliest possible date in the CD  their shared goal of a treaty banning the production of fissile material  for nuclear weapons purposes. They expressed their determination to  this end. In that context, they look forward to meeting again, with  other relevant parties, during the United Nations General Assembly First  Committee. We are hopeful that the P5, working with other relevant  partners, will be able to chart a productive path forward.
Plutonium Management and Disposition Agreement
On a similar front, just last month, Secretary of State Clinton and  Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov brought the U.S.-Russian Plutonium  Management and Disposition Agreement and its 2006 and 2010 Protocols  into force. The amended Agreement commits each country to dispose of --  under strict non-proliferation conditions -- no less than 34 metric tons  of excess weapon-grade plutonium, which represents enough material for  about 17,000 nuclear weapons in total. Disposition of the plutonium is  scheduled to begin in 2018 following construction of the necessary  facilities. The two countries and the IAEA are making progress on  appropriate IAEA verification measures for each country’s disposition  program.
Nuclear Weapon-Free Zones
Nuclear weapon-free zones are a high priority for the United States.  At the 2010 NPT Review Conference, Secretary Clinton announced that the  Administration would submit the protocols to the Africa and the South  Pacific nuclear weapon-free zones to the U.S. Senate for advice and  consent to ratification. This was done on May 2 of this year. As  Secretary Clinton also committed last May, the United States is  consulting with the parties to nuclear weapon-free zone treaties in  Central and Southeast Asia in an effort to reach agreement that would  allow us to sign the protocols to those treaties.
Middle East WMD Free Zone
A related issue is the proposal for a zone free of  weapons-of-mass-destruction in the Middle East. For months we have been  meeting regularly with the other co-sponsors of the 1995 resolution on  the Middle East and the UN to determine the best way to fulfill our  responsibilities as laid out in the plan on the Middle East endorsed by  the NPT RevCon in a way that will best ensure a successful conference.  We are fully committed to this effort. However, the success of the  conference and similar efforts cannot be imposed from outside. It will  depend on the willingness of the regional states to help build an  atmosphere conducive to constructive dialogue on all relevant issues.
Nonproliferation
President Obama stated in Prague that, “We need real and immediate  consequences for countries caught breaking the rules or trying to leave  the treaty without cause.” The 2010 NPT RevCon Action Plan underscores  the importance of resolving all cases of non-compliance with safeguards  obligations. Our collective efforts in the UN Security Council regarding  the nuclear challenges posed by Iran, Syria, and North Korea are  designed with these goals in mind, and we look forward to continued  cooperation with the international community in seeking to resolve these  situations.
The United States, other Member States, and the IAEA Secretariat are  actively considering ways to strengthen the IAEA safeguards system, and  the United States remains committed to ensuring the Agency has the  resources and political support it needs to make effective use of its  existing authorities. A comprehensive U.S. review of potential options  for strengthening safeguards produced several recommendations, including  improving the IAEA’s abilities to investigate potential and actual  undeclared nuclear activities, ensuring that the IAEA has reliable  funding to meet its evolving safeguards mandates, and expanding  adherence by all relevant states to NPT safeguards agreements and the  Additional Protocol.
Since the NPT RevCon, nine countries have put Additional Protocols  into force. As of August 22, 2011, 110 states have Additional Protocols  in force and another 25 states have signed them, but have not yet  completed their ratification process. We are committed to universalizing  these important safeguards instruments. To this end, we are working  with our partners to engage countries without them to address concerns  they have with bringing them into force and to provide assistance in  implementation where necessary.
While the 2010 Final Document did not include consensus on the issue  of abuse of the NPT’s withdrawal provision (Article X), it did note that  many NPT Parties “underscore that under international law a withdrawing  party is still responsible for violations of the NPT.” We will continue  to pursue measures to dissuade such abuse with other NPT Parties.
Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy
The third pillar of the NPT is the peaceful use of nuclear energy.  The United States continues its active effort to fulfill its commitments  under the Treaty’s Article IV to international peaceful nuclear  cooperation with states that abide by their nonproliferation  obligations. At the RevCon, Secretary Clinton announced a Peaceful Uses  Initiative to raise $100 million over five years in new funding for IAEA  activities in peaceful uses of nuclear energy, including projects  related to human health (especially cancer), water management, food  security, and nuclear power infrastructure development. In support of  this new campaign, the United States has pledged $50 million and is  seeking funding from other countries to match that amount before the  next Review Conference in 2015; Japan, South Korea, and New Zealand have  already stepped forward to join us in this effort with contributions of  their own. Our own contributions have funded more than $10 million in  specific projects in these areas since the RevCon, benefitting more than  80 IAEA Member States.
It is important that we ensure that the worldwide expansion of  nuclear power not be accompanied by an increased threat of nuclear  proliferation. That could result if more countries seek to acquire their  own sensitive fuel-cycle facilities, in particular enrichment or  reprocessing plants. Since the 2010 RevCon, the IAEA Board of Governors  has approved, without a single negative vote, two new measures to assure  IAEA members of an adequate supply of fuel for peaceful nuclear power  plants -- a low enriched uranium reserve to be established under IAEA  auspices at a location to be determined and the United Kingdom’s  proposal for nuclear fuel assurances.
Conclusion
Challenges and threats to the NPT must be effectively addressed so  that progress in one area is not undermined or negated by actions in  another area. Countries with nuclear weapons will be reluctant to disarm  when they perceive risks that additional states might acquire such  weapons, one of the reasons nonproliferation compliance is so important.  Conversely, the indefinite possession of nuclear weapons by some states  can erode the willingness of non-nuclear weapon states to maintain or  strengthen their commitments to forgo them. In sum, we cannot succeed in  disarmament without continued progress in nonproliferation, and vice  versa. We must all commit to work together to carry out and strengthen  the goals and objectives of the NPT.
We have come a long way in the last two years and our hard fought  achievements should inspire us all to accomplish even more. Although the  challenges ahead are great, and we have a much longer road yet to  travel, we’re confident that by working together we can make further  progress as we seek to achieve a world without nuclear weapons. The  stakes and the benefits to all states are enormous, and all states must  do their part to make the NPT’s objectives a reality. Let us take this  opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to work together to achieve these  objectives and to ensure the future success of the NPT.
Thank you. I welcome our discussion and your questions.

Nuclear Politics





Nuclear Politicsfrom The Diplomat by Manpreet SethiLast  December, the United States and Belarus entered into an agreement that  was hailed as a non-proliferation success. Under the deal, Belarus  agreed to hand over several hundred kilograms of highly enriched uranium  in its possession to Russia for downblending. But on August 19, Belarus  announced that it was suspending the agreement in response to economic  sanctions imposed by Washington over its crackdown on the opposition. While the United States often engages in such moves to ‘promote respect  for human rights,’ what has made this case especially interesting is the  use of nuclear material as a bargaining tool. Clearly, the contemporary  threat perceptions of the United States outlined in the Nuclear Posture  Review of 2010, namely the twin threats of nuclear proliferation and  nuclear terrorism, have led Belarus to believe it has a winning hand. From 1991 to 2001, the United States saw the breakup of the Soviet  Union, the return of ...              Read More...

The Importance of Alternative Energy to the U.S. Military





The Importance of Alternative Energy to the U.S. Militaryfrom OilPrice.com Daily News Update by karbuz@oilprice.com (Sohbet Karbuz)Much  has been written on the dependency of the US military on oil. However,  most of the writings focus on the supply side of the issue and emphasize  the role of technology primarily on alternative fuel production. A US  Army research paper by Colonel Fields is rather different. That is why this post is about his paper.
Col. Fields argues that “A country equal or near equal in economic  and military power but considerably less depend on fossil-fuel-based  technologies would pose a major threat to our nation.” In the context of  Peak Oil, which he seems to be subscribed to,

Earthquake and Hurricane Irene Impact U.S. Nuclear Power Industry





Earthquake and Hurricane Irene Impact U.S. Nuclear Power Industryfrom OilPrice.com Daily News Update by admin@namecake.com (John Daly)Since  the 11 March Fukushima nuclear disaster, the global nuclear industry  has been mounting an aggressive PR campaign to convince an increasingly  skeptical public that not only is nuclear energy safe, it has a number  of benefits, such as zero carbon dioxide emissions.

The center  of the global nuclear industry is the United States, where the first  civilian nuclear power plants for generating electricity were built and  which now operates 104 commercial reactors, producing roughly 20 percent  of the nation’s electricity.  Until Fukushima, nuclear power advocates  saw a potential renaissance of the industry – besides arguing the global  warming
