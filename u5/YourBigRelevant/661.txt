Gay, straight couples more monogamous today
by Sharon Jayson on Sep. 05, 2011, under USA Today News





Cheaters may get more attention, but couples of all types are more monogamous than they used to be, finds research on more than 6,800 people in heterosexual, gay and lesbian relationships.
“Our findings reveal a marked movement toward monogamy over time,” says the study in the September issue of the journal Family Process, online now.
The study of 6,864 men and women — responses were collected from 6,082 individuals in 1975 and from 782 in 2000 — examines differences on a variety of issues, including monogamy.
“There’s dramatically less extra-relational sexual behavior in the year 2000 than in the year 1975 for all couple types,” says researcher Robert-Jay Green, a psychology professor at Alliant International University in San Francisco.
Although the most recent data are from 2000, Green says it allowed for a direct comparison because the questions posed were the same used in 1975.
The percentage of heterosexual men who reported having sex with someone other than their wife dropped to 10% in 2000 from 28% in 1975; among married women, it declined to 14% from 23%. Among gay men, the percentage who cheated on a partner they lived with dropped to 59% from 83%; for lesbians it declined to 8% from 28%. Half the gays and lesbians in the study were in civil unions, half were living together in committed relationships, the researchers say.
The authors “speculate that awareness of HIV/AIDS and other STDs has led couples to be more cautious and more conservative about sex outside their relationships over the last 25 years.”
But Green says it’s also a result of greater acceptance of same-sex relationships.
Emily Hecht-McGowan  of the non-profit Family Equality Council, which works toward equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender families, agrees. “As public opinion has shifted about gay people and the LGBT community overall, I think same-sex couples are more comfortable living openly in their communities and building families,” she says.
“Some might expect monogamy is not something that typifies same-sex couples, but clearly the trend is in the opposite direction,” says psychologist Glenn Roisman of the University of Illinois-Urbana-Champaign. He hasn’t seen the research but has studied committed relationships.
Roisman says his research about relationship satisfaction, relationship quality and commitment among same-sex and opposite-sex couples published in 2008 and 2009 found that past perceptions about same-sex couples are “not always aligned with the reality.”
“What we found surprised some — that they had relationships of about the same quality” as heterosexual couples, he says.

Reward travel for employees makes a comeback
by Charisse Jones and Roger Yu on Sep. 05, 2011, under USA Today News





Even during the recession, Jay Hagan refused to stop rewarding his top performers with free hotel stays.
“It’s really a relatively small part of our total employee budget and has such a big impact,” says Hagan, CEO of DriveSavers Data Recovery in Novato, Calif. “It seemed even more important to continue to do it when things were slow.”
Now, travel industry experts say, many of Hagan’s peers are again rewarding employees as corporate profits have started to rebound and the avalanche of bad publicity about employee-incentive travel has dissipated.
But while reward travel is returning, they say, the trips may not be as long or as lavish as they were before.
“The reality is, it’s back because these programs work, especially in decentralized organizations,” says Melissa Van Dyke, president of the Incentive Research Foundation.
“The programs are still motivating,” she says. “They’re still creating experiences that are memorable and meaningful. But some of the incentives that were there before, like round-trip transfers or room gifts, aren’t there anymore.”
Fading backlash
While business travel was slashed across the board when the global economy was in recession three years ago, incentive travel was hit particularly hard following news reports of companies and government agencies spending lavishly on retreats at fancy resorts.
The public backlash reached a boiling point in October 2008 when executives at insurance giant AIG spent more than $400,000 for a trip to the luxurious St. Regis in Monarch Beach, Calif., a week after the firm received an $85 billion bailout from taxpayers.
The backlash has eased, and industries have started to take the clamps off incentive travel. “If we had to put a score on it, it’s probably 85% to 90% back,” says David Peckinpaugh, president of Maritz Travel, a meeting management company.
Resorts that traditionally have relied on incentive travel groups are reporting higher sales.
At Atlantis Paradise Island in the Bahamas, group sales are about 20% higher than a year ago, and incentive meetings comprise about 65% of all group sales at the resort. Sales will increase again in 2012, says Mark Benson, the resort’s vice president of group sales.
“Incentive travel is showing the fastest rate of growth in all group business,” Benson says, adding that the resort sold about 200,000 group room nights this year vs. 146,000 a year ago.
Corporate meeting planners also see business picking up.
“Until this year, I haven’t had a call in years — going back to pre-2008 — from a new client who said, ‘Can you do an incentive (trip)?’” says Christy Lamagna, president of Bernardsville, N.J.-based Strategic Meetings & Events, which plans meetings for corporate clients.
One of her clients, a pharmaceutical company, increased its incentive travel budget by 20% this year. After sending top salespeople on a modest trip to Maui in 2010, she says, the firm this year is heading to “a very exotic destination” overseas.
Selling points
Free trips for the family, rubbing elbows with top executives and bragging rights have always been touted as the selling points for incentive travel.
Industry veterans say businesses have returned to the realization that rewards and incentives can get their sales forces to be more productive and distributors working a little more aggressively on their behalf.
“For the group that it applies to, it definitely has that ability to give them something to focus on that’s different than just the paycheck,” says Paul Hebert, managing director of I2I, a company that does incentive program design.
Contrary to the image projected by the so-called AIG effect, industry experts say, it’s not top executives who benefit most from the rewards.
“It’s been oftentimes discussed as bankers and those types of individuals who go on these trips,” Van Dyke says. “But it’s more often your local insurance agent or your retailer … in your hometown.”
 Studies indicate that for every dollar spent on incentive travel, $3 to $5 are added to a company’s bottom line,  says Steve O’Malley, senior vice president of Maritz Travel and president of the Site International Foundation, which supports the incentive travel industry.
And with only 12% of employees believing that their companies listen to and care about them, according to a Maritz poll released earlier this summer, “Companies are realizing they really need to recognize and reward their employees,”  Peckinpaugh says.
‘More common sense’
Still, reward trips have changed. Recipients may now fly coach and stay in the USA,  industry experts say.
The Incentive Research Foundation has found that spending now averages about $2,500 a person, and 67% of trips include some type of meeting or business aspect. Only 22% of trips cover all the costs of flying, such as the extra fees for checking bags, Van Dyke says.
“They’re applying a lot more common sense to it,” Hebert says. “They’re still doing room gifts. But it might be a travel kit with interesting and fun things in it or it might be an item that’s indigenous to the location, a carving you can fit in your luggage that (is) … not worth that much.”
 O’Malley  added that a social-responsibility component often is part of the new incentive travel programs. “We’ve seen the content of these programs shift over time as well to reflect what’s going on in the culture, this idea of giving back,” he says.
Whatever the incentives, Hagan says they’re worth giving. He rewards his 80 employees with one-night certificates to stay at a Fairmont, Ritz-Carlton or Hyatt hotel. And it seems to keep them satisfied.
“The average tenure of our employees is more than 10 years, so we have very few people who leave our company,” he says. “I guess that’s probably the best measure I can think of.”

Mitt Romney calls his health-care law an asset against Obama
by USA Today Feed on Sep. 05, 2011, under USA Today News





Mitt Romney, trying to turn a political lemon into lemonade, predicted that his record of enacting a controversial Massachusetts health care law would be “one of my biggest assets” in a campaign debate against President Obama.
The last of five presidential contenders speaking at a South Carolina Tea Party forum, Romney denied comparisons made by Obama and others between the state law and the federal law that followed. The Bay State legislation he signed didn’t raise taxes, didn’t cut Medicare and didn’t affect most of the state’s population, he said.
And the federal version?
“It’s bad law; it’s bad medicine,” he said at the Palmetto Freedom Forum, organized by South Carolina Sen. Jim DeMint. “It has got to be stopped, and I know it better than most.” As president, he said he would move to grant waivers to states and seek repeal of the law.
Romney initially had turned down an invitation to speak at the forum, then accepted a few days ago after losing his frontrunner status in national polls to a new contender, Texas Gov. Rick Perry. It was expected to be the first time the two men had appeared on the same stage, but Perry canceled at the last minute to return home to deal with wildfires in the Lone Star State.
They are scheduled to see each other soon: At a GOP debate Wednesday at the Ronald Reagan Library.

Sexist men and women made for each other
by Robert Preidt, HealthDay on Sep. 05, 2011, under USA Today News





When it comes to aggressive courtship strategies, sexist men and women seem to be perfect for each other, new research suggests.
U.S. researchers conducted two surveys: One included 363 college students at a large Midwestern university, and the other was a national Internet poll of 850 adults.
The male and female participants were asked about their sexist attitudes toward women and whether they were willing to engage in uncommitted or short-term sex. Men were also asked how often they used assertive strategies to initiate relationships and women were asked if, and to what degree, they found these types of advances desirable.
The researchers found that men who favored casual sex were more likely to use aggressive courtship strategies, while women who were also open to casual sex were more likely to respond to such approaches.
The surveys also revealed that men with negative, sexist attitudes toward women were more likely to use assertive strategies, and women with sexist attitudes toward other women were more likely to respond to these overtures.
The findings were published recently in the online edition of the journal Sex Roles.
“Our results suggest that assertive courtship strategies are a form of mutual identification of similarly sexist attitudes shared between courtship partners,” Jeffrey Hall and Melanie Canterberry, of the University of Kansas, reported in a journal news release.
“Women who adopt sexist attitudes are more likely to prefer men who adopt similar attitudes. Not only do sexist men and women prefer partners who are like them, they prefer courtship strategies where men are the aggressors and women are the gatekeepers,” the authors concluded.

Michele Bachmann takes a jab at Mitt Romney
by USA Today Feed on Sep. 05, 2011, under USA Today News





Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann, the first up at the South Carolina Tea Party forum, took a shot at one of the candidates who was slated to soon follow: Mitt Romney. Without mentioning names, she said that not only was the federal mandate requiring Americans to obtain health care coverage unconstitutional. She said that it was “inherent in the Constitution” that any state mandate also would be unconstitutional.
Like, say, in Massachusetts. When he was governor, Romney signed into law a Bay State health-care program that did just that.
Romney hadn’t been scheduled to attend the American Principles Project Palmetto Freedom Forum, organized by South Carolina Sen. Jim DeMint. But he signed up last week after Texas Gov. Rick Perry jumped in the race and immediately took Romney’s position at the top of the Gallup Poll and other national surveys. That was a sign of Romney’s new status and strategy, including increased outreach to the Tea Party movement.
Earlier today, however, Perry cancelled, heading back to Texas to deal with the state’s wildfires.
Bachmann said it was critical to repeal what she called Obamacare now, because once implemented “we will never get rid of it.” She also called to eliminate taxes on U.S. companies repatriating profits from overseas, a step she said would generate jobs at home.

Youth sports to cause 3 million lost teeth
by Robert Preidt, HealthDay on Sep. 05, 2011, under USA Today News





Dental injuries are all too common among young athletes, especially those playing basketball and baseball, an expert says.
“Basketball and baseball are the two biggest mouth-injuring sports. And the most common injuries we see are broken, displaced or knocked out teeth, and broken jaws,” Dr. Stephen Mitchell, an associate professor in the pediatric dentistry department at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, said in a university news release.
It’s estimated that more than 3 million teeth will be knocked out in youth sporting events in the United States this year, according to the National Youth Sports Safety Foundation.
Mouth guards and helmets with face protectors can help reduce young athletes’ risk of dental injuries.
“If the child has a full set of permanent teeth then a custom guard can be made that will provide protection but be small enough to make it easy to communicate with teammates,” Mitchell said. “But if they still have some of their baby teeth, a custom guard is a waste of money. Parents will be better off going to the store and buying one of the guards that can be boiled and molded to their child’s mouth.”
If a child does suffer a broken or cracked tooth, see a dentist within 24 hours. If a child loses a tooth or teeth, immediately go to the emergency department and try to preserve the tooth/teeth.
“A tooth that has been knocked out needs to be back in the mouth within 30 minutes for the best chance of long-term survival,” Mitchell said.
If your child is old enough not to swallow the tooth, you can try to gently place the tooth back in its socket. If that’s not possible, place the tooth in milk. Don’t put it in water and don’t handle it by the root, which is easily damaged, Mitchell advised.

Mayor: Boy, 12, killed in Sumatra earthquake
by USA Today Feed on Sep. 05, 2011, under USA Today News





Updated at 4:53 p.m. ET
A 12-year-old boy has died in a 6.6-magnitude earthquake that struck Sumatra, Indonesia, early Tuesday morning, a local mayor says, according to the Associated Press.
The word came from Maura Sakti, mayor of Subulussalam, who gave the news to the local station TVOne, according to the Associated Press.
No other details were available.
Residents of Singkil, an area near the epicenter, said electricity poles fell and crashed into houses.
“My wife was screaming; my children crying,” Burhan Mardiansyah, 37, is quoted as saying. “We saw our walls start to crack and everything inside the house was falling.”
Updated at 3:42 p.m. ET:
Hundreds of patients have had to be evacuated from a hospital in Medan, Sumatra, near the epicenter of the Tuesday morning earthquake, the Associated Press is reporting. The temblor has been classified as 6.6-magnitude by the U.S. Geological Survey.
Some of the patients were in wheelchairs and others had infusion drips attached to their arms, the news organization reports.
Residents of homes and guests at hotels also were seen fleeing in panic.
Telephone calls to officials in Singkil, an area believed to be hit hard, have gone unanswered, according to the Associated Press.
Earlier post:
An earthquake of 6.6 or 6.7 magnitude has shaken northern Sumatra in Indonesia, though there are not yet any reports of damage or injuries, BNO News and other news organizations are reporting.
The temblor struck very early Tuesday local time and was centered about 62 miles southwest of Medan, in Sumatra, BNO reports.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said no tsunami had been generated, according to BNO.
The center, based in Hawaii, said the quake was too far inland to set off a tsunami, the Khaleej Times reports.
Indonesia is part of the Pacific “Ring of  Fire,” where a meeting of the continental plates generates high seismic activity.
A 9.1-magnitude earthquake in December 2004 centered off Sumatra triggered a massive tsunami that killed more than 220,000 people around the Indian Ocean, the Times reports.

Mouse halts Nepal-to-Thailand flight
by USA Today Feed on Sep. 05, 2011, under USA Today News





Everything was going peachy on a Nepal Airlines Boeing 757 at the international airport in Katmandu earlier today until a furry critter upset the balance of things.
A mouse darted out of the pantry and made its way toward the back of the plane, Fox Television reports. At that point, the crew did the only thing that made sense – they canceled the flight headed to Bangkok, Thailand, until they could find the fleet-footed rodent.
Unlike most passengers, who reach their plane via the terminal and security, the mouse likely boarded the plane via a food-catering truck, airline spokesman Raju K.C. told the Associated Press.
The crew had the jet towed to a hangar and evacuated the passengers, who did not see the critter. The plane will not hit the skies again until the mouse is found, the airline told the Associated Press.

Keeping your retirement savings on track
by Matt Krantz on Sep. 05, 2011, under USA Today News





Q: How much should the typical 45-year old currently have invested for retirement?
A: Investors are realizing, the hard way, that there’s no substitute for saving when it comes to retirement. During large parts of the 1980s and 1990s, if investors were a bit behind saving for retirement, it wasn’t a big deal. Stocks did so well during large periods of time in those decades, remarkable returns could fix many faulty retirement investment plans.
Talk about a stock market that could fix even the worst retirement plan. Stocks posted positive returns every year during the 1980s, except in 1981, when they fell just 4.9%. It was a similar situation in the 1990s, with stocks posting positive returns in every year of the decade except for a 3.1% decline in 1990. Some of the annual returns in the 1980s and 1990s were nothing short of breathtaking. Investors knew, and they were right, that if they just saved a little and stayed invested, they’d be fine.
But everything changed in 2000. Suddenly, following a string of three annual losses, investors found out the stock market gravy train had run dry. Returns since 2000 have been anemic at best. Making things worse, historic levels of volatility have prompted many investors to panic and sell, missing out on sporadic rallies.
The bottom line? It’s back to basics. And when it comes to investing, the most fundamental basic is saving. Where should the typical 45-year-old be?
It’s impossible to answer that question based on the data provided. There are dozens of factors that will determine the answer, including how much you plan to spend each year in retirement, how much you make and when you plan to retire. However, it’s an interesting exercise. Using IFA.com’s Retirement Analyzer, and some general assumptions, you can get a general idea of how much money you should have at this point.
For this calculation, I’ll assume you have a household income of $80,000 and that your income is expected to grow by 2% a year. I’ll also assume you plan to save 10% of your income each year for retirement, plan to retire at 65, need $50,000 a year in today’s dollars to live over 30 years after retirement.
Running the analysis, and keeping all the assumptions in mind, it would appear that you should have at least $275,000 saved at this point. If you have $275,000, and maintain your savings rate, you will have enough money to last you to age 95 if the market turns in an average return.
Certainly, if the market has an above average run, you might end up with more than $14 million in your estate. But there’s an equally small chance the market will do much worse than average and you could run out of money as soon as age 76. But these are extremes that have only a 10% chance of occurring.
And that’s why $275,000 is a good proxy of where you should be. It never hurts to save more to give you more protection from unexpected events.
Given the fact the stock market isn’t likely to bail you out, you simply must learn to cut costs and postpone spending to boost savings. And don’t make the mistake of thinking Social Security will bail you out either.
The only way most people will have any chance at retiring amid this age of subpar returns is to save as much as they can.

Obama asks if GOP will ‘put country before party’
by USA Today Feed on Sep. 05, 2011, under USA Today News





President Obama used Labor Day to offer a preview of his big jobs speech later this week, challenging congressional Republicans today to support items that have received bipartisan support in the past.
“We’re going to see if we’ve got some straight shooters in Congress,” Obama told a friendly crowd at a labor picnic on Detroit’s waterfront. “We’re going to see if congressional Republicans will put country before party.”
“Show us what you got,” Obama said at another point, referring to Republicans.
As he prepares to address a joint session of Congress on Thursday evening, Obama indicated he will call for an extension of a payroll tax cut, as well new road and bridge projects. He described these as ideas that “both parties” can agree on.
“Labor is on board — business is on board,” Obama said. “We just need Congress to get on board.  Let’s put America back to work.”
Obama spoke to a very friendly labor crowd, members of which serenaded him with chants of “Four more years! Four more years!”
In a speech with heavy campaign undertones, Obama thanked union member for their political support. The president also decried efforts by Republican governors in Wisconsin and Ohio to change the rules for public employee unions, and vowed to protect collective bargaining rights nationwide.
Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, said his party has a different view of the best way to create jobs.
“While the president champions regulations, mandates and tax hikes, Republicans across the country have stood up for American workers by supporting pro-growth initiatives,” Priebus said.
In his Detroit remarks, Obama said his speech to Congress on Thursday will detail “a new way forward on jobs.”
Obama declined to offer a full preview — “I don’t want to give everything away right here” — but he did cite the proposed payroll tax cut extension and new infrastructure projects, ideas he has discussed before.
“The time for Washington games is over,” Obama said. “The time for action is now.”

MDA telethon raises $61.5M without Jerry Lewis
by USA Today Feed on Sep. 05, 2011, under USA Today News





Despite the absence of longtime veteran host Jerry Lewis, the Muscular Dystrophy Association telethon’s broadcast went on and  had what the MDA is saying its best showing since 2008.
So You Think You Can Dance judge Nygel Lythgoe was joined by co-hosts Nancy O’Dell, Jann Carl and Alison Sweeney during the six-hour live broadcast on Sunday night. According to MDA officials, the 46th annual Labor Day weekend event raised nearly $61.5 million, about $2.6 million more than last year, reports the Associated Press. The telethon was shortened from more than 20 hours of broadcast time last year.
And while during the show, Lythgoe and Carl referred to Lewis as “retired,” the AP reported that Lythgoe said after the broadcast ended on the East Coast that he thought the 85-year-old actor would show up either during the telecast or earlier to film a taped segment of his signature song, You’ll Never Walk Alone.
Lewis has not publicly discussed his split from the MDA, where he no longer serves as chairman. Remarks during the show were the first time the MDA has addressed Lewis’ departure since it was announced, and telethon spokesman Jim Brown declined further comment about the split, according to the AP.
During the broadcast, Lythgoe paid homage to Lewis and said, “It isn’t possible, Jerry, to replace you, sir.”

‘The Help’ escorts summer out on top
by Scott Bowles on Sep. 05, 2011, under USA Today News





Hollywood’s summer at the movies stumbled to the finish line this weekend as The Help claimed the No. 1 spot for the third straight weekend.
While the best-seller adaptation has been one of the few bright spots of summer, TheHelp‘s Labor Day weekend victory was due largely to another weak slate of new films. The Help claimed $19 million this weekend, according to estimates from box office trackers Hollywood.com.
The $25 million Viola Davis drama has done $123.4 million since its release a month ago. The film held off a thriller and competing horror films this weekend, which marks the end of Hollywood’s summer season.
Among the newcomers, the espionage thriller The Debt acquitted itself well, taking second place with $12.6 million and meeting most analysts’ expectations. The film, which drew primarily audiences 30 and older, earned recommendations from 77% of the nation’s critics, according to survey site Rottentomatoes.com. About 73% of audiences gave it a thumbs-up, according to the site.
Competing horror films Apollo 18 and Shark Night 3-D were left to battle for box office scraps.
Apollo 18 did $12.6 million, meeting most of its modest expectations. Critics had it for lunch: Just 21% recommended the movie.
Shark fared a similar fate. Given a thumbs-down by 76% of critics, the 3-D film did $10.3 million.
Rise of the Planet of the Apes rounded out the top five with $10.25 million, lifting the picture’s overall gross to $162.5 million.
Final figures are due Tuesday.
The lackluster summer did nothing to help the industry’s sales slump: attendance for 2011 is down about 5% from the same time last year, while revenues are down 4%, according to Box Office Mojo.
“We didn’t get nearly the bump we expected, even with big-name sequels” this summer like Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 and Transformers: Dark of the Moon, says Jeff Bock of Exhibitor Relations. “This summer ended with one of the biggest whimpers I’ve ever heard. Or never heard.”

With back now flaring up, Colts say Manning doubtful for opener
by USA Today Feed on Sep. 05, 2011, under USA Today News





The Indianapolis Colts have now officially addressed rumors about the halting progress of QB Peyton Manning‘s neck surgery. It seems his recovery now also includes back problems.
The team released a statement Monday. It reads, in part:


During the last week, the rate of  improvement in Peyton’s rehabilitation process slowed. Over the weekend Peyton  experienced soreness in his back. It was originally thought to be a normal  reaction to his rehabilitation regimen. When the soreness persisted, the Colts  medical team decided to initiate diagnostic tests and to consult with a number  of specialists around the country who have been involved in Peyton’s case from  the outset. That process continues. As a result of the most recent development  the doctors have decided that Peyton will not practice. His participation  therefore, in Sunday’s game versus Houston will likely be doubtful. We will  update his playing status as required by NFL policy as the week goes  on.
At the conclusion of the  diagnostic process, if there are any new developments in the prognosis which we  outlined for Peyton at the start of training camp we will report them. As of now  Peyton continues to deal with a complicated neurological recovery, the end date  of which is unpredictable.
As was stated at the outset, it  serves no useful purpose to speculate about hypothetical outcomes. When and if  there are concrete medical facts to report we will do so.

The NFL’s only four-time MVP, Manning has started 227 consecutive games (including playoffs), second only to Brett Favre (321) among quarterbacks. Unlike Favre, Manning has started from Day 1 after being drafted first overall by Indianapolis in 1998.
“Obviously, when you  look at it it’s been an incredible feat. He’s been an ironman,” said Colts coach Jim Caldwell.
“I don’t know what  other way to put it. He’s been there every step of the way. And obviously it’s  doubtful that he’ll play this weekend, but nevertheless, it takes a very unusual  individual to put that kind of string together.”
The Colts have only missed the postseason twice in Manning’s 13-year tenure, including his rookie season. He has twice led the team to the Super Bowl, including a victory in Super Bowl XLI after the 2006 season.
But after passing for a career-high 4,700 yards last season, Manning had surgery in May, the second operation on his neck in 15 months. He’s cited the lockout as a reason for his slow convalescence as he was unable to rehab with Colts medical personnel for most of the offseason.
“I hate it for Peyton,” said Colts C Jeff Saturday. “You want him  to be healthy, you want him to be back, but you want him to take care  of it, too. It’s sad when players face tough times, but I know he’s  strong enough to get through it.”
If Manning can’t play at Houston in Week 1, the Colts will have to decide between starting recently signed veteran Kerry Collins or third-year player Curtis Painter, who had two forgettable regular-season appearances in his rookie year.
“Certainly, in no  way do I think I could replace someone like Peyton, and what he means  to this franchise and this city,” said Collins. “But at the same time, I have been doing this  for a long time. I guarantee that I will bust my butt to get ready to play this  week. I hope the guys see that. I know what it takes to prepare and be  successful in this league, so I’m going to do all those things, rely on all the  experience that I have. I have a good idea of what I need to do to get ready to  play and give a winning performance.”

Rick Perry skips GOP forum to deal with Texas fires
by USA Today Feed on Sep. 05, 2011, under USA Today News






Updated 2:33 p.m. ET
Texas Gov. Rick Perry is skipping a presidential forum in South Carolina later today to return to his home state to deal with wildfires there, the governor’s office told USA TODAY.
Perry had urged caution to Texans during the Labor Day weekend and re-issued an emergency disaster proclamation for all 254 counties.  As of Thursday, wildfires in Texas had burned more than 3.5 million acres and destroyed more than 728 homes, according to the governor’s office.
Perry and Texas’ two GOP senators, Kay Bailey Hutchison and John Cornyn, have criticized the Obama administration in the past for denying the state’s request for a federal disaster declaration and for not doing more to help Texans affected by the wildfires.
Perry appealed the Obama administration’s denial in May, and received partial approval of relief on July 1. A request to expand the scope of federal relief is still pending, Perry’s office said today. 
The National Weather Service warned that wildfires burning in central Texas could spread today because of dry brush, high winds and low humidity.
Six Republicans, including Perry, were slated to participate in the presidential forum sponsored by Sen. Jim DeMint, a Tea Party favorite. DeMint, who endorsed Mitt Romney in the 2008 GOP presidential race, so far is withholding his support in this year’s race.
Perry will head back to Texas after a town hall meeting in Conway, S.C., with U.S. Rep. Tim Scott, a freshman Republican who was elected to Congress in November with Tea Party support.

Colts put Tressel in timeout with de facto suspension
by USA Today Feed on Sep. 05, 2011, under USA Today News





Raiders QB Terrelle Pryor just entered the NFL saddled with a five-game suspension similar to what he would have served had he played at Ohio State in 2011 (though he’s fighting the ban again amid much waffling).
For those who thought new Colts assistant — and former Buckeyes coach — Jim Tressel should get similar treatment after joining Indianapolis’ staff last week, well now he is.
In a statement released by the team Monday, Colts president Bill Polian said:


After the announcement of Coach  Jim Tressel’s agreement to join the Colts as a game day consultant, questions  were raised with respect to the equity of his appointment as opposed to  suspensions being served this season by present and former Ohio State  players.
Over the weekend Coach Tressel,  Mr. Irsay (team owner Jim Irsay), Coach (Jim) Caldwell and I had a discussion of the issue. In addition, we  had a conversation with league officials to apprise them of the details of Coach  Tressel’s employment and the issues we were reviewing.
At Coach Tressel’s suggestion,  and with Mr. Irsay’s concurrence and support, we have decided to begin Coach  Tressel’s employment effective with our seventh regular season game. We have  informed the league office of our decision and expect that they will be  supportive of it.
We are very happy Coach Tressel  will be joining us.

Tressel was to serve a five-game suspension, along with his players, at Ohio State to begin the 2011 season before he resigned in May after admitting he had failed to notify the NCAA that several Buckeyes (including Pryor) had received improper benefits.
Tressel will serve as a video replay analyst for the Colts, starting in Week 7, helping Caldwell determine when questionable plays should be challenged.

Obama labors over jobs speech
by USA Today Feed on Sep. 05, 2011, under USA Today News





One of President Obama’s labors for the day: Honing the big jobs speech he delivers to Congress on Thursday evening.
Obama is likely to offer a preview this afternoon when he gives Labor  Day remarks in Detroit. The White House schedule says the president  plans to discuss “his bipartisan efforts to create jobs and strengthen  our economy.”
White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters that the president “has spent certainly a part of the weekend putting the finishing touches on his proposals and the  (Thursday) speech. And I think that that process continues over the next few days, but he’s very far along.”
The big jobs speech is likely to dominate White House news coverage this week, right up to Obama’s joint appearance before the House and Senate on Thursday at 7 p.m., eastern.
The president is also developing a debt reduction plan he plans to forward to a special congressional committee later this month.
Facing 9.1% unemployment, Obama is expected to stress items Congress can act on now. They are expected to include new infrastructure projects, including schools and roads; free trade agreements; and an extension of payroll tax cut, as well as tax credits to employers who hire new people.
“We need to take action to spur growth and accelerate hiring,” Carney said. “The President will put forward a number of proposals that have historically enjoyed bipartisan support and will, without question, if enacted, positively affect growth and job creation.”
Republican critics such Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., said they sense the Obama speech will be “more of the same.”
DeMint, who wants Obama to focus on less regulations, told CNN’s State of the Union that, “frankly I am so tired of his  speeches, it’s going to be hard for me to watch.”
“We need a plan in writing,” DeMint said. “Without sending  something in writing the president makes all of these grand gestures and then it  doesn’t appear in any legislation and then he will blame Congress for not  passing something he never sends over.”

Job searches futile for 25% of older teens
by Paul Davidson on Sep. 05, 2011, under USA Today News





Summer’s unofficial end closed out a dismal season for working teen-agers.
The unemployment rate for 16- to 19-year-olds ticked up to 25.4% in August from 25% the previous month, the Labor Department said last week. For black teens, unemployment leaped to 46.5% from 39.2% in July. The nation’s jobless rate was unchanged at 9.1%.
Equally disconcerting: the jobless rate for teens of all races has hovered around 25% all summer each of the past three years, marking the worst such stretch on records back to 1948. 
Summer teenage unemployment averaged 13% in 2000 and 15.8% as recently as 2007.
The prolonged slump has serious implications for America’s future adult workers. Summer jobs are critical for teaching youths “soft skills,” such as how to deal with customers and managers, says Michael Saltsman, research fellow at the Employment Policies Institute.
A 1995 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found high school seniors who worked 20 hours a week can expect to earn 21% more in annual salary and 11% higher hourly wages six to nine years later.
Yet just 29.6% of all teens worked this summer, tying last year’s all time low. In 2000, more than half of teens worked. 
In a report last year, the Bureau of Labor Statistics cites several reasons for the long-term trend, including many teens in summer school and more high school graduates enrolling in college.
Also, jobs traditionally held by teens, such as grocery cashiers and retail sales associates have been replaced by technology, Saltsman says. The recession accelerated the trend, with many teens losing out to laid-off workers with more experience in the hunt for low-level jobs.
To help working youths, Saltsman says the federal government should give employers more flexiblity to pay them as much as $3 below the minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. Now, such a “training wage” can only be paid for 90 days.
Saltsman cites a study by Miami and Trinity universities showing the increase in the minimum hourly wage to $7.25 from $5.15 from 2007 to 2009 reduced teen-age employment nationwide by 2.5%, or 114,000 workers. 
Dean Baker, co-director for the Center for Economic and Policy Research, says Washington should revive job programs for low-income youths as part of an economic stimulus.

Christian crusaders cash in with charities
by Bob Smietana, The Tennessean on Sep. 04, 2011, under USA Today News





Back in the 1980s, Jay Sekulow’s career was in shambles. His Atlanta-based law firm had failed, leaving him millions in debt and bankrupt.
Then he got a lifeline from a surprising source — the U.S. Supreme Court.
Sekulow’s client, San Franscisco-based Jews for Jesus, was locked in a legal dispute with commissioners at the Los Angeles airport. The group wanted to hand out religious literature there. Airport officials said no. Sekulow argued the commission’s actions violated the First Amendment.
The Supreme Court ruled 9-0 in Jews for Jesus’ favor, a victory that launched Sekulow’s new calling as a crusader for Christians who believed their legal rights were being threatened.
Sekulow’s story was chronicled in major newspapers.
For Sekulow, it was like being born again.
“I almost feel like God raised me back from the dead,” he told the Atlanta Journal Constitution in 1991. “It was a spiritual rebirth.”
Sekulow, a celebrity among conservative Christians, now sits as the principal officer of two closely related multimillion-dollar legal charities: Christian Advocates Serving Evangelism, which he founded in San Francisco, and the better-known American Center for Law and Justice, founded by Christian broadcaster Pat Robertson and based in Virginia Beach.
Jay Sekulow Live — a call-in radio show — draws millions of listeners. He’s a regular commentator on Fox News and splits his time living between Franklin, Tenn., and the Washington, D.C., area. Attorneys from his two charities are suing to rescind national health care reform and to block the proposed mosque near ground zero.
Along with its spiritual benefits, Sekulow’s new calling has come with significant financial benefits.
Since 1998, the two charities have paid out more than $33 million to members of Sekulow’s family and businesses they own or co-own, according to the charities’ federal tax returns.
One of the charities is controlled by the Sekulow family — tax documents show that all four of CASE’s board members are Sekulows and another is an officer — an arrangement criticized by a nonprofit watchdog group.
The founder of a different Christian legal organization takes aim at the idea of Sekulow profiting in the name of religion, saying it isn’t what Jesus would do.
The American Center for Law and Justice’s tax attorney says the payments to the Sekulows and businesses they own or co-own are all made for the charities’ benefit and have passed an IRS audit. Sekulow’s supporters say he is a humble man dedicated to the Christian cause.
Members of the Sekulow family declined requests for interviews. John Hoover, a Washington, D.C.-based tax attorney with Dow Lohnes who advises ACLJ, responded to written questions from The Tennessean.
“The arrangements between ACLJ, CASE, and companies of which Jay Sekulow has an ownership interest are on terms and conditions more advantageous than the organizations could obtain otherwise,” he wrote.
But Daniel Borochoff, president of the American Institute of Philanthropy, a charity watchdog group, said there’s a problem when a charity’s board is dominated by family members.
Nonprofit board members are supposed to be independent and look out for the best interests of donors. That’s nearly impossible with so many family members on a board, he said, after reviewing three years of CASE and ACLJ tax returns.
“Are they going to operate in the best interest of the family or the best interest of the charity or the public?” he said. “They are only human.”
John Whitehead, founder of the conservative Rutherford Institute, a Christian civil rights charity founded in 1982, was more blunt about Sekulow, whose work he has followed for years.
When Christian charities become successful, he said, they can lose sight of the ethics of their faith, which include handling money with care. Six-figure salaries and perks like a private jet clash with Christian ideals about charity.
“If you read the New Testament, the founder of Christianity said, ‘I have no place to lay my head,’ ” Whitehead said. “I am aghast at modern evangelism and the money.”
The IRS requires nonprofits to disclose the compensation of their leaders.
But a donor to ACLJ wouldn’t know how much Sekulow is earning from his work with the organization, even though he is described as CEO, chief counsel and board member on its tax forms. ACLJ reports that Sekulow has taken no salary since 2002.
However, ACLJ’s 2009 tax form shows it paid $2,382,770 to the law firm 50 percent owned by Sekulow –(AT) Constitutional Litigation and Advocacy Group. The firm’s office address is in a building owned by CASE.
In addition, Sekulow was paid $85,747 by CASE in fiscal year 2009.
‘Very small’ income
In a phone call, Ronn Torossian, a public relations executive serving as ACLJ’s spokesman, portrayed Sekulow as a great lawyer getting by on modest pay.
“You are asking about one of the most successful lawyers in the country whose income is very small and owns a very small home,” he said.
Property records show Jay and Pam Sekulow own three homes, including one they bought in 2008 in Franklin for $655,000 and another in Norfolk, Va., bought in 2005 for $690,000. Their third home, which once belonged to CASE, is in Waynesville, N.C., and is assessed at $262,800, according to Haywood County, N.C., tax records.
Sekulow’s supporters say they believe he acts with integrity in his business and personal dealings. They describe him as a humble and generous man who is dedicated to serving God.
Darren Tyler’s Conduit Church meets at a high school in Thompson’s Station, Tenn., a right it indirectly owes to Sekulow. In 1993, Sekulow won a case — one of nine he’s won at the Supreme Court level — that allowed churches more access to rent space at schools.
Along with the church, Tyler also leads a small nonprofit that works in Haiti. He said that Sekulow interviewed him on air several times after the Haitian earthquake in 2010, raising thousands of dollars to rebuild homes in that impoverished country. Sekulow also donated to the rebuilding, Tyler said.
“That’s the Jay Sekulow I know,” he said.
2 charities, 1 name
Sekulow was running CASE before he became involved in ACLJ in the 1990s. Today both charities operate under the name American Center for Law and Justice. When supporters send donations to ACLJ, the funds actually go to CASE, which handles the fundraising for both groups, tax records show.
Borochoff worries that donors will search for details about ACLJ’s finances and find only the tax returns for that group, not CASE, so they won’t get full details of how their donations are spent. Many of the transactions that benefit members of the Sekulow family are disclosed on the CASE returns, but not the ACLJ’s.
“People should know where their money is going,” he said.
The ACLJ website does include a notice at the bottom of the page saying that CASE does business as the ACLJ. Torossian, the spokesman, said all donors get a receipt that makes clear that the funds went to CASE.
Borochoff said it’s obvious that the Sekulows are talented and very effective attorneys. He’d like to see them change the way that CASE and ACLJ operate, so that questions about their business practices don’t interfere with their mission.
In his eyes, that involves merging CASE and ACLJ and adding more non-family members to the organization’s board of directors.
“They need to operate more seriously as an organization,” he said.

TV report: Peyton Manning likely to miss regular season opener
by USA Today Feed on Sep. 04, 2011, under USA Today News





The reports conflict, but they suggest the same thing: Peyton Manning’s neck isn’t healing as quickly as he and the Colts would like.
ESPN’s Adam Schefter tweeted that the Colts will address Manning’s status for the Sept. 11 season opener against the Texans by noon ET Monday.
Late Sunday night, WTHR in Indianapolis reported “several sources” indicated Manning will not play in the team’s season opener. The station and ESPN’s Chris Mortensen both reported that the quarterback is being re-evaluated by several doctors because he is progressing slowly from offseason neck surgery. Mortensen, however, has not confirmed that Manning will miss any regular season time, despite the evaluations.
The latest reports of Manning’s injury setback started early Sunday night when radio talk show host John Michael Vincent of ESPN 1070 in Indianapolis tweeted that Manning needs another neck procedure and he will remain out “indefinitely.”
In another tweet, Vincent, who goes by his initials on the air, said, “I’m not trying to be a newsbreaker. Never cared for that. I thought you  would like to know. seems to be solid. If I’m wrong U can torch me.”
Mortensen’s report refuted Vincent’s tweet, saying no new neck procedure is being planned at this time.
The Colts responded quickly as Sports Illustrated‘s Peter King tweeted a nebulous response from team president Bill Polian. According to King, Polian said, “I don’t know anything about that. I honestly don’t.”
Several minutes after authoring the Polian tweet, King came back and suggested that at the very least, he is “starting to believe” Manning won’t be ready for Week 1 against the Texans.
Manning has had two neck surgeries in the last two years, including one earlier this year. The recovery from his most recent surgery has gone slower than expected and the quarterback has, in part, blamed on that on the NFL lockout, which kept him away from team trainers.
Manning has started 227 consecutive games, including the playoffs, the second-longest quarterback streak in NFL history, trailing only  Brett Favre.  The ESPN report notes, “Of all the numbers Manning has put up over the years, the streak is the one he has usually said means the most.”
