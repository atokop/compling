His full name was Pedro de Alcântara Francisco António João Carlos Xavier de Paula Miguel Rafael Joaquim José Gonzaga Pascoal Cipriano Serafim (English: Peter of Alcantara Francis John Charles Xavier of Paula Michael Raphael Joachim Joseph Gonzaga Pascal Cyprian Seraph.). He was born on 12 October 1798, in Queluz, the fourth child of King Dom João VI of Portugal and Infanta Charlotte of Spain.

He was a member of the Brazilian branch of the House of Braganza and was referred to using the honorific "Dom" from birth. His father's abrupt abdication and flight to Europe left a 5-year-old Pedro as Emperor and led to a grim and lonely childhood and adolescence. Obliged to spend his time in studying in preparation for rule, he knew only brief moments of happiness and encountered few friends of his age. His experiences with court intrigues and political disputes during this period greatly affected his later character. Pedro II grew into a man with a strong sense of duty and devotion toward his country and his people. On the other hand, he also increasingly resented his role as monarch.  http://wn.com/Pedro_II_of_Brazil    Pedro Álvares Cabral  Pedro Álvares Cabral ( in European Portuguese or in Brazilian Portuguese; c. 1467 or 1468 – c. 1520) was a Portuguese noble, military commander, navigator and explorer.

While details of Cabral's early life are sketchy, it is known that he came from a minor noble family and received a fine education. He was appointed to head an expedition to India in 1500, following Vasco da Gama's newly opened route around Africa. The object of the undertaking was to return with valuable spices and to establish trade relations in India—bypassing the monopoly on the spice trade then in the hands of Arab, Turkish and Italian merchants.  http://wn.com/Pedro_Álvares_Cabral    Phoenicia  Phoenicia (Brit.

Sarepta (modern day Sarafand) between Sidon and Tyre is the most thoroughly excavated city of the Phoenician homeland. The Phoenicians often traded by means of a galley, a man-powered sailing vessel, and are credited with the invention of the bireme.  http://wn.com/Phoenicia    Portuguese Brazilian  '''  http://wn.com/Portuguese_Brazilian   Raúl Zibechi  http://wn.com/Raúl_Zibechi   Thomas Skidmore  Thomas Elliot Skidmore (Troy, 22 July, 1932) is a noted historian and scholar specialized in Brazilian history.  http://wn.com/Thomas_Skidmore    World War I  World War I was a military conflict centered on Europe that began in the summer of 1914.

Clint Dempsey and Landon Donovan grabbed goals in the first period, but the South American champions roared back with a Luis Fabiano brace and a Lucio header to pick up their third FIFA Confederations Cup crown. The United States not only heeded their coach's pre-game battle cry by not conceding an early goal, but they ran out and notched a surprise opener for themselves after only ten minutes. A lovely cross from right-back Jonathan Spector was met on the volley by Clint Dempsey and guided gently inside the back post by the Fulham striker. The Brazilians, just three minutes after being stunned by the well-crafted American goal, marched right up the other end, Manchester City star Robinho forcing Tim Howard into a fine save with a curling shot from the edge of the box. The USA seemed to know that trying to defend a 1-0 lead for too long against a team as dangerous as Brazil would be asking for trouble, so continued to try and press the ball high up the field.

With the brave and militarily-organised Koreans holding the pre-tournament favourites for almost an hour, the Selecao kept their heads until a moment of brilliance from Maicon broke the deadlock. The Internazionale right-back's wicked, swerving shot cut inside the near post at pace to highlight the World Cup ball's added movement and give his side the lead as the deep-lying, counter-attacking Koreans looked set to pull off a huge shock. Elano looked to have sealed the win with 18 minutes left when he stroked Robinho's wonderful through ball into the bottom left as the Koreans, in their first World Cup since 1966, committed men forward. But a superb goal from Ji Yun-Nam in the 89th minute set samba pulses racing as Carlos Dunga's side held on to go top of the so-called 'group of death' after Ivory Coast and Portugal ground out a goalless draw earlier. Until Maicon's freak opener - from some angles it looked like he intended to cross the ball - Jong Hun Kim's unfancied team belied their FIFA ranking of 105 as they matched top-rated Brazil's skill with a flat back five and endless endeavour.
