We just had an eathquake here near Schenectady, NY.  We think it may be from the Virginia earthquake.  Tall office buildings and lightposts swayed.  Very unusual for Upstate, New York.  Waiting for data.

WTF is the problem?  How much more can these news outlets stretch this story out for the lack of panic except in the newsrooms because they can’t get LIVE video feed from their collegues??
Did those ‘fine upstanding’ rebels of Libya upset the balance of the earth when they all gathered in the Qaddafi compaound?  Who was that stupid congress person who said the island would tilt if too many peple gathered on side of it??  I mean this is running along those same ‘crazy’ lines.

Taqq, no offense, but John McTernan is a nut when it comes to simple science. The comet is too small to have any effect, even if it was aligned with Earth and the sun. We have moments when Sun, Earth and our moon are aligned, and the moon has significantly more mass than a comet for 3-4 kilometers. C/2010 X1 is a long-period comet and very likely a regular guest to our system. STEREO-B and SOHO will observe the forward scattering of light, which should be quite interesting.
The commons speculations all lead to the Nibiru collision nonsense and from there it’s just a small step to aliens invading our toilets. Conspiracy theories are running rampant in those circles.
Theoretically, if it would impact, we’d have serious issues, but then again, it won’t do that. Plus, one day it will happen anyway. It has happened in the past, it will happen again. Every 500,000 years or so this planet is hit by stuff larger than 1 km. Welcome to the universe, it’s a dangerous place.
As for earthquakes… hellooooooo… the tectonic plates on this planet have been moving for millions of years and will continue to move until the planet is literally dead. Quakes have always happened and will always happen.

I’d be more impressed if it had been an 8.0 or 9.0 and had happened while Congress was in session.   There are quakes every day, but most are so minor they are not felt.  We have them in Oklahoma and rarely are they even noticed by the populace.

OT but did anyone see the Libyan rebel interviewed on Fox via Sky news ? He got into Qaddafi’s bedroom and got his hat and a gold chain that was huge and by todays prices if he sold it he would have several thousand dollars. He was ecstatic about the hat and I kept thinking “go sell that chain”.

Correct. Japan has a few hundred every year. 3-11 was just the big one that a lot of scientists have actually been waiting for. 
BTW, West Coast US, San Andreas fault (love the name), should also be hit eventually. Scientists have been waiting for a big one for a while.
Those are fault areas, tectonic plates move, the earth shakes. Simple as that. The coming hurricane in the South? It’s hurricane territory, nothing new there. 
Welcome to nature, enjoy your stay. And yes, nature is more powerful than mankind.

			#52			August 23, 2011 at 2:06 pm WillofLa commented:

A geologist called into the radio show I was listening to and he said that it had been centuries since that area had a earthquake.  He said that fault was very deep.
Yeah, it’s probably coming from the lines of strata that form the Appilachian mountains, but deep.  Hum.  
Yeah, you’d know that the liberals would have run out of the Capital building like the rats jumping ship that they are.  To bad that all, ALL the liberals weren’t in that tunnel going out into Virginia from the Capital and our representatives buildings, and it caved in taking them all out!  Then that way the largest majority in Washington would be the conservative Republican’s.  Then when Obama came back from Martha’s Vineyard he’d have no one to support his crazy ideas that are destroying this nation.  You know that Obama is good friends with Maurice Strong who thinks he runs the world with all his bogus organizations and even more bogus NGO’s.  Our conservative Republican’s could defund all the U.N. agreements where we don’t know where the money goes.  America could begin returning back to where it ought to be.  And if all the liberals were dead, Obama couldn’t do a damn thing to stop it.  I would like to see him in a situation like that, and I would like to see America in a situation like that, where we would have a small conservative government that got the things done that it is supposed to do and that’s all.

Fantastic observation from a brilliant man and one truly representative of conservative intellect. Yes, the fact Obama was golfing when an earthquake occurred is reason to criticize BO. Of course, when Katrina hit, W took days to even think about touring the devastation, and when he did, he made his usual ass of himself. But, how quickly the right wing forgets. Jim, you also forgot to mention Obama is black. That MUST have had something to do with the earthquake. Oh, and did I forget to mention Obama is a black man? Jim, there’s chicken stock, fish stock, beef stock and then there’s you…laughing stock.

They’ve upped it to 5.9 which doesn’t surprise me. It felt strong and shook a really wide area. I guess it was a deep one.

#55:  LMAO. Get a grip.  You appear to be in the late stages of Bush Derangement Syndrome.  Bush saved 30,000 lives during Katrina via the US Coast Guard.  He didn’t need to “tour the devastation.” The only reason the left hated him was because he forgot to bring the welfare handouts for the people whose family legacy is sitting on their asses and bitching about racism.
When can we expect you to go to Mineral, Virginia to volunteer, Mel Dekker, and back your words up with actions?

			#70			August 23, 2011 at 3:02 pm WillofLa commented:

Yeah, yeah, I know a lot of people don’t want anyone killed or hurt in any way.   Well, if it were under normal circumstances I to, would not wish anyone killed or hurt.  I’m not some kind of Oger, I’m a normal person.  But when you see these people getting away with murder, of the American way of life for everyone except their cronie rich friends, and they have reconstructed our government in such an unAmerican way that it favors laws that destroy all that the Constitution is supposed to protect?  What else would you suggest?  That we think that everything is okay, and if we don’t like what they do, all we need to do is what our system allows and just vote these people out of office?  Sure, that would work if we didn’t have a Marxist for President who passes an illegitimate Presidential Directive just before he leaves for vacation he shouldn’t be taking, that violates our immigration laws that are established to keep illegal Mexican’a from being given amnesty?  C’mon, give me a break.  
And then when right thinking people try to get bills to the floor of the House to stop such things as what Obama has gotten away with since he’s been in office that has done more damage to this nation than anyone before him, and his supporters in the House and the Senate won’t allow a bill that protects the freedoms, liberties, and rights of the American people because they are just as mentally ill as this nut job President?  What would any normal person think ought to happen when they know that just voting harmful people out of office has not stopped these people from harming this nation as long as there is one left in office and another one in support of them in the White House?  Just be nice and tell them to “Please stop hurting America.”?  They aren’t going to do any of that.  They are going to laugh at you and then order the police to arrest YOU for being criminal in not supporting your government.  
No, they can’t do that yet, but that IS what they want to get to do as long as they can take as many freedoms, liberties, and rights away from you that gives you the ability to stop them and turn things around.  What would you suggest under those circumstances, a slap on the wrist?  No, something much more “permanent” needs to happen to these people.  Even in the Holy Bible there is plenty evidence where even God knew He had to bring these people’s influence, threats, pressure on people’s survival, people who are weak and are easy for these people to talk them into doing what they want them to do, that at that point it would be better that those kinds of people die.  That way their influence and threats, and pressure from their ideas won’t harm people anymore.  It may take longer to have those people die, but at least it finally ends the damage that they have done and after those people are gone the people can begin to recover.  It is hoped that the people won’t allow anyone like those people to get into positions of power again, but it’s only until someone comes along who thinks that the government should be taking care of us that you find that someone trying to influence someone they are right and then support for them and their screwed up ideas begins again.  
That’s why, since nothing like liberalism and liberals and a Marxist has never tried to destroy this nation has never happened before and people aren’t real sure what to do about it.  But one thing is for sure, we cannot allow these people who have been doing these things to our nation and our way of life, to exist running around free to build up support and money and power so they have what they need to take over again.  We must learn how to spot these people and make sure that they are gotten rid of early before they build up a movement.  And getting rid of them can be as easy as sending them to therapy, then if they don’t stop they may have to be put in prison for their own good, and ours to.

Mel Dekker @55:
Oh come of it, we’re just have some fun at the expense of Preisdent ItsNotMyFault.
As for Bush and Katrina:  I’ve been involved with disaster recovery since just after 9/11, and can tell you for a fact that with operations ongoing after Katrina’s landfall, having to deal with the logistics of a presidential visit in the first couple days would have been counter productive.  Nevertheless, Bush visited the area twice within 4 days after landfall (first a flyover, and a couple days later with boots on the ground).
 Moreover, Federal aid and recovery assets were in place before landfall (e.g. by 8/27/2005…[FEMA]Region VI had staged at Camp Beauregard, Louisiana, 270,000 liters of water, 680,000 pounds of ice, 15,120 tarps, and 328,320 Meals Ready to Eat (MRE). By 5:00 pm edt, the quantity of water stored at Camp Beauregard had doubled to 540,000 liters. More commodities were pre-staged elsewhere in Region VI.).
Your gripe has no basis in fact.

How exactly is the left trying to destroy the US?
I could count the ways, but you could just do the work instead, and google “Ways the Left is Destroying America”, and you would have a million good explanations.
It’s all about Communism, and decades-long plans.
http://www.americanthinker.com/2008/09/barack_obama_and_the_strategy.html
Start there.  If you’re not afraid to be challenged.  Or just be a complete intellectual pu&&y, and stay in your bubble of unicorns and Skittles.
How about you research Mao’s Great Leap Forward.  Or the Holodomor.  Or Walter Duranty’s intenional coverup of the Holodomor.  Or Barack Obama’s staff’s publicly expressed love for Mao Tse Tung.  Or Barack Obama’s relationship with Frank Marshall Davis.  Or Barack Obama’s relationship with Bill Ayers and Bernadine Dorhn, former Weather Underground terrorists dedicated to killing people (like all Communists are), and now tenured University professors, inculcating and brainwashing thousands of young minds per year.
Or you could just go smoke another bowl and be blissfully ignorant.

It was actually Bill Clinton’s fault, like everything else

It was God sending a message to Christians to tell them to stop believing in Jesus. When are Christians going to learn? If 9/11 didn’t wake them up after Pat Robertson warned them that it was the hand of God, they never will.

This earthquake was a big one  5.8 or 5.9 on the Richter scale, and covering a large, heavily populated area.  The only reason we can joke about it in good conscience is that there was very little damage, and no deaths.  
Our buildings are made to withstand this magnitude of earthquake. 
God has blessed us in a big way, because we put His blessings to good use.

I didn’t in fact suggest that God was trying to awaken believers. My comment was that God was trying to awaken those who believe in Jesus as the Savior. Thus God could be telling them that Judaism or Buddhism or Islam or even some as yet uncreated religion could be the more accurate one.

I don’t suppose Obama has blamed this earthquake on George Bush? The only one who tried to blame it on someone was Jim. He said, “Earthquake Rattles Washington DC – Obama Goes Biking.” He wanted to blame Obama for going biking. Going biking actually isn’t a bad thing to do.
Don’t get me wrong. There are things to criticize Obama for. The headline could be, “Earthquake Rattles DC – Obama Creates $1.8 Trillion Debt,” or “Earthquake Rattles DC – Obama DOJ Covers Up Illegal Gun-Sales Operation Directing Guns to Mexican Drug Lords,” though both of those headlines would be complete nonsequitors, just like the one Jim did pick to run.

GREAT POST! The implication of your headline is certainly correct; i.e., that Obama should have stopped everything to deal with the non-crisis of the earthquake, but instead was insensitive enough to continue his vacation with his little girls.  Thank you, Jim, for bringing this clear inconsideration of the president to our attention.

You’re a sick bastard. Preach some more eliminationist rhetoric, Herr Goebbels, maybe the Southern Poverty Law Center will add you to their list of hate groups.
You really do hate America, you hate the fact that people outside your purview can have attitudes and opinions different from your own, and you want to deny freedom, pursuit of happiness, and even life to anyone who doesn’t fit within your narrow window of what’s acceptable. It’s people like you who are the real traitors to America, and I’m calling you out Gateway Pundit.

			#126			August 24, 2011 at 5:24 am Stentor commented:

#124 was directed squarely at you WillofLa for #52. You demonize Democrats for all of the same things Republicans have done, like give amnesty to illegals, which Ronald Reagan did, and all of those people engaging in crony capitalism? Those would be the friends and business associates of the Bush Family, they have a long storied history of engaging in such practices, going all the way back to Prescott Bush’s involvement with Fritz Thuyssen, Union Banking Concern, & a little construction company called Eigen-Farber. So get your facts straight before you go off half-cocked on some hate-filled rant about how liberals are ruining this country, because it’s the conservatives who enable the businessmen on Wall Street that are wrecking it.







 


			#127			August 24, 2011 at 7:30 am Rock commented:

Boy the Left goes bat sh!t crazy when their toy boy leader is ridiculed. Jim creates a post that allows the Right to vent at WTF expense, and suddenly everything is taken literally. Poor fools are learning they no longer control the message nor the tone and are at a loss on how to respond, to funny.
Oh Stentor, does that only apply to the Right or are you at peace With Maxine, F. Wilson, and WTF’s people of the New Black Panthers, talk about seeing the world through blinders mean anything to you? Most of what was said here was in jest poking fun at WTF something the Left does as a matter of doing business. You really are taking yourself way to serious, seriously.







 


			#133			August 24, 2011 at 6:07 pm Liadan commented:

This is *not* the Washington Earthquake.
The Earthquake epicenter was in Cuckoo, Virginia.  Virginia is a Red state with a Red governor.  If anything the “Great Cuckoo Earthquake” is McConnell’s and the GOP’s fault.  And just to make His point, He’s sending Hurricane Irene to drive it home.







 


			#135			August 26, 2011 at 8:43 pm Stentor commented:

There’s a big difference between telling someone to go to hell, and wishing that a large group of people would have been killed in an earthquake through specific circumstances that would benefit another group ideologically opposed to them politically. Stop the false equivalence, because they’re not the same.
Rock, you can go to hell with your BS of “oh yeah, he was just kidding” because that’s a load of crap, same tactic that I used to encounter in high school with bullies getting caught by authority figures with their threats and saying, oh, I was just kidding. That’s a chickenshit tactic by moral cowards who want to preach eliminationist rhetoric but don’t have the balls to back it up when you call them on it, typical bullies.
You want to see batshit crazy, you need to go visit some Tea Party websites where they preach non-stop violence against the left. I didn’t get angry because of the poke at Obama going biking, I got angry at WillofLa’s commentary about the large-scale death of liberals, there’s a difference, another misdirection on your part.
I don’t see the large amounts of threats of violence on the websites I visit that have a left-wing audience, I only see it on sites like Michelle Malkin’s, and others.
The New Black Panthers are a joke and no one takes them seriously except for people who want to stoke the fear-mongering of black radicals intimidating whites, it’s baloney.

			#138			August 26, 2011 at 9:07 pm Stentor commented:

Okay, I guess I’ll try this again.
Rock, there’s a big difference between telling someone to go to hell as Maxine Waters did, and WillofLa wishing for large scale deaths of groups of people he’s ideologically opposed to so the other side would gain some sort of political advantage as a result. That’s a false equivalence on your part, the two are not the same. Besides, the New Black Panthers are a joke, and the only people that take them seriously are the ones who have a stake in stoking the fear-mongering of black radicals intimidating white people.
You want to see batsheee-it crazy, you need to go visit some Tea Party websites where they post comments advocating large amounts of violence against individuals and groups of people on the left, something I do not see when I visit websites with left-wing or liberal audiences.
I didn’t get angry because of Gateway Pundit’s comments about Obama, I got angry at WillofLa’s comments advocating eliminationist rhetoric against liberals.
The “Oh, I was just kidding” when you’re called on this is morally cowardly because it indicates a hatred that you’re unwilling to stand up for when you’re called on exactly what you mean, or others mean, when someone points out the implicit violence in those statements. Something I used to see from the chicken-sheee-it bullies in my hometown when various authority figures would catch them engaging in some sort of threatening behavior. “Oh, I didn’t mean it, I was just kidding, can’t you take a joke?” Give me a break, everyone sees through that for what it really is.
And Rock? Short English lesson, the word is “too” not “to” as in “too funny” and “too seriously” implying superlative description over and above “to” which is inclusive. You want to be taken seriously, then do, as they say in certain circles, “This is America, learn English.”
