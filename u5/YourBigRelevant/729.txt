Virginia quake shakes Merrimack Valley

	Virginia's earthquake yesterday afternoon didn't stay in Virginia.

	Merrimack Valley residents reported feeling tremors following a magnitude 5.8 earthquake earthquake near Mineral, Virginia, south of Washington D.C..

	From Salisbury to Billerica, area residents said they saw buildings shaking and even felt dizziness and nausea for a few seconds just before 2 p.m.

	Readers left comments on The Eagle-Tribune's Facebook page, reporting earthquake effects in Billerica, North Andover, Lawrence, Haverhill, and Salisbury. Others called to report quake effects in their area.

	Marco Sparo, 65, said he was sitting at his desk at work in Lawrence when he felt his desk moving back and forth for a few seconds. The sensation stopped, but then Sparo noticed his water trembling.

	"I said to myself, 'This building is moving,'" Sparo said.

	Watching the water move, he said, reminded him of a movie scene from Jurassic Park as dinosaurs are approaching. Sparo said he's never felt an earthquake in the region.

	"I've been here all my life, and I've never felt one," Sparo said.

	Deborah Quinn, a Methuen resident and a candidate for Methuen School Committee, said she was on the fifth floor of Lawrence General Hospital when she felt the tremors.

	She and two family members were seated in an hospital room when the empty hospital bed started shaking. Quinn said she wondered whether construction was going on in the building or outside.

	"It was so minor," Quinn said. "The three of us were just looking at each other like, 'What is this?'"

	Lawrence resident Ruth Diaz, 44, said she felt the quake as dishes shook in the china cabinet. The U.S. Geological Survey's website said the quake struck Virginia at 1:51 p.m. and shook the East Coast, with reports of the quake's tremors reaching north to Maine and south into North Carolina.

	Uri ten Brink, a senior scientist and research geophysicist for the U.S. Geological Survey, said different people will feel different parts of an earthquake depending on their location. He said Lawrence residents could feel heavy shaking while another town's residents could feel nothing.

	"It is very, very individual and very personal," ten Brink said.

	Jose A. Cruz, 58, was working on the eighth floor of a Boston office building when he felt the effects.

	"I thought at first I was getting dizzy or something, but I saw tables moving back and forth," said Cruz, a Lawrence resident.

	Peter Judge, spokesman for the Massachusetts Emergency Management Association, said there were no reports of damage yesterday in the Bay State, although some Boston buildings chose to evacuate as a precaution.

	Police departments in Lawrence, Methuen, and Haverhill did not receive any calls about the shaking or any earthquake-related damage.

	Justin Starr, a research assistant at Boston College's Weston Observatory, said the intensity of the shaking felt in Massachusetts would likely be rated a 2 on a 10-point scale, which is described as weak.

	Some parts of Virginia reported shaking that rated a 6, causing some damage, according to the U.S. Geological Survey's website.
