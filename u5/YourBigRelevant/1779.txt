Earthquake may have exceeded Virginia nuclear plant's safeguards





The earthquake that prompted the shutdown of a Virginia nuclear power plant last week may have been more severe than the plant’s reactors were designed to withstand, federal regulators said. The revelation is likely to put increased pressure on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to quickly implement a series of safety recommendations intended in part to protect plants from major natural disasters like earthquakes. NRC said Monday that its preliminary analysis indicates that the ground motion caused by the magnitude-5.8 earthquake near the North Anna Power Station in Louisa County, Va., exceeded the maximum level the two reactors at the plant were built to handle. "We have informed the NRC that preliminary reports from instruments show the earthquake potentially exceeded the design basis," Dominion spokesman Ryan Frazier said. "All reports are not final, and probably will not be until the end of the week." Frazier stressed that inspections have found no major damage to the plant. "All safety systems operated as designed and built," he said. Dominion restored power to the plant late Tuesday night and lifted an emergency alert the following day.While there have been no reports of major damage at the plant, nuclear critics have pounced on the incident, arguing that it highlights the vulnerability of the U.S. nuclear fleet to major natural disasters. A federal task force said in a report released last month that the NRC should make wide-ranging improvements to the “existing patchwork of regulatory requirements and other safety initiatives.” The task force was mandated by President Obama in the aftermath of the nuclear disaster at Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi power plant.

Message to first time readers:




Optimism and an open mind are the most radical political acts there 
are.

We have thousands of energy options that can save our economy and planet without 
sacrificing our resources or lifestyles.
 

The general public only hears of the few options that line the pockets of the 
few that result in the suffering of the many.   
 

The public information on this website makes it easy for anyone to clearly 
understand how viable and abundant our future can really be.  


We are not activists, 
treehuggers or politicians...
we are EHS 
professionals who have thoroughly enjoyed everything this planet and its people 
have offered us and want to extend the quality of life for both.
 
NOTE:  
I post articles because I think they are of interest. Doing so doesn’t mean that I necessarily agree with every—or any—opinion in the posted article.
 And although I often blog about disagreements, it is
 VERY important to understand that I agreed more with the ideas of 
President Obama and Dr. Chu than disagreed.  (it is just part of 
democracy, it gives balance and is vital)

From me to you - Thanks!
 
No I don't 
support the idea of never ending war in our world. 
But I do have to support the 
people who have given me the right and freedom to complain about it.
 
 
Please 
support our veterans by doing anything you can to boost theirs spirits and 
hope.
