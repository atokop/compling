Hurricanes and Other Disasters - Shop Before, Not After


 If you are new to the hurricane game, here is a bit of advice from sad experience... "Shop before, not after."  People are probably a lot smarter today than my family was 40 years ago (a lot more media today), but it's worth passing along some wisdom for those who may not have experienced a hurricane (or other natural disaster) before.
While living in the Philippines in 1970, we experienced Typhoon Yoling.  A typhoon is the Asian version of a hurricane.  With winds at 130 MPH plus it was a harrowing experience.  This was our very first experience with such a storm.  We really did not know what we were doing.
 We survived the storm and immediately hopped in the car to go to the grocery store.  Somehow we dodged downed trees and roof tops ripped from houses and strewn on the ground and actually arrived at the local grocery store.  The store was lit only by candles placed strategically on certain shelves and at the checkouts.  They may as well not have bothered with the candles because there was nothing left to buy.  The shelves were totally empty except for, as I remember it, a bottle of pickled pigs feet (literally).
I will never forget the site of a full size grocery store empty but for a few orphan items that no one considered particulary helpful after a monster storm. As I recall we bought nothing because there was nothing to buy - we missed the boat. We lived for the next two weeks mostly on the rice we had stored, whatever canned goods were in our pantry, and what we could rapidly eat up from our refrigerator and freezer.  This was a true survival experience.  It was around Thanksgiving time and so we cooked our turkey on a barbecue grill.  It was that or have it go bad as there was no electricity or running water for two weeks.
I'm sure that today everyone would understand that job one, well before landfall of a hurricane, is to stock up with needed groceries and supplies.  This is a lesson I will not need reinforced.  I will forever have the image of a single candle burning next to a single bottle of pickled pigs feet etched in my mind.
 The time for preparation is "before the storm".  As applied to any potential disaster, shop before, not after.  Since many disasters do not give the lead-time that is often a luxury with a slowly approaching hurricane, there won't be time to get ahead of the disaster.  An earthquake, for example, will usually hit without warning.  The time to prepare and "shop" is right now perhaps days, weeks, months, or years before the need arises.  Now is the time to get your emergency kit and emergency supplies and then keep them up to date so you don't find yourself trying to shop empty shelves after he fact.

Should You Evacuate In A Hurricane? If In Doubt, Get Out!


 With Hurricane Irene bearing down on the East Coast, many are asking themselves if they should evacuate to safer places.  While residents should obviously pay attention to guidance from local authorities, my own experience would say, "If in doubt, get out!"  Don't mess with winds that can gust beyond 100 MPH.  The winds and the accompanying storm surges and flooding can be deadly.
I have survived a direct hit by a super typhoon (the Asian version of a hurricane) with sustained 130 MPH winds.  I did this with my family in a house with a corrugated tin roof and large glass sliding doors.  It is amazing that we made it through without any injuries.  Not all were so lucky in that same storm.  In that situation in 1970 in the Philippines, there were no evacuation shelters to go to.  Had there been, it would have been wise to have use them.
Don't mess with Category 3 and Category 4 hurricanes.  If you are in a vulnerable area or live in less than a sturdy home, evacuate.  It is simply not worth taking the chance.  Historically, many who have stayed in less than safe situations have perished, and those who did survive would often have made different choices.  I know I would today.  It is very scary and dangerous to sit out the storm. 
Once you are trapped by the high winds and accompanying water, there is little chance to change ones mind.  If you do not evacuate early, there comes a point where any attempt to evacuate only exposes you to greater risk.  So evacuate early and ensure your safety.  Don't risk staying in harms way.

FEMA Urging Preparedness As Hurricane Irene Approaches


 As the East Coast braces for a potential Category 4 Hurricane Irene, FEMA urges preparation for evacation and shelter in place.  Don't wait until the storm surge and damaging winds hit.  Prepare now if you live on the East Coast.
If you live elsewhere, think of this as one more reminder of the importance to be prepared at any time for any emergency or disaster.

First An Earthquake, Now a Hurricane - Be Prepared and Hang on East Coast


 Hey East Coast, don't get so focused on the ground shaking from the Virginia earthquake that you forget to prepare for the greatest hurricane threat in the last three years, Hurricane Irene.  Some forecasts are calling for Irene to strengthen to up to a Category 4 Hurricane with winds of over 155 miles per hour. Make your evacuation and shelter in place plans now. 
The combination threats that have been evidenced in both the earthquake and this hurricane, make it clear that we all need to have an emergency kit and emergency supplies ready for any emergency or disaster.  Don't wait to prepare until the threat is evident.  Be secure by being prepared at all times.

Expect Cell Phone Networks to be Clogged After An Earthquake or Other Disaster



 Cell phone networks were clogged and callers had a hard time getting through after the Virginia/DC earthquake today.  As we have seen in other disasters, don't count on the ability to use your cell phone after a major disaster.  Even though this earthquake didn't bring down any cell towers, the volume of "Did you feel it?" calls quickly overwhelmed the cell phone network capacity.
This points out the need to have a plan that will allow you to respond to a disaster even if you can't use your cell phone to communicate for hours or days.  This may mean having a predesignated meeting place or an alternative contact in case of an emergency.

If You Live In Earthquake Country, Do You Have An Earthquake Kit?


  First Question:  Do you live in earthquake country?  Simple to find the answer, just check this map.  If you live in a shaded area (most of us do) then you live in earthquake country.
 
If you do live in earthquake country then go to question #2.
Second Question: Are you prepared to survive an Earthquake?  Hopefully so.  If you are not sure (or you are quite sure that you are not),consider these earthquake survival priorities...
Priority #1: Make sure that you survive the earthquake.
Priority #2: Make sure your emergency earthquake kit survives the earthquake.
 In a severe earthquake, second only to surviving yourself is making sure that your earthquake emergency survival kit makes it through the initial earthquake with your emergency supplies intact.
As we have just been reminded by earthquakes in Virginia and Colorado, we can experience earthquakes almost anywhere in the United States, and after a big earthquake you'll need to be prepared with an earthquake kit to meet your own emergency survival needs for at least 3 days (72 hours) or longer. No government is prepared to immediately meet the needs of its entire population after a devastating earthquake. 
 
It is critical then that your emergency supplies be protected from the falling debris that can crush your unprotected earthquake supplies. Your earthquake kit may have adequate emergency supplies to help you survive the first few days after an earthquake, but is it built to survive the initial earthquake and to protect your supplies?
Do you have an earthquake kit that is built to survive the quake and then to help you survive?
MobileAid 3-Day Emergency Earthquake Kits for 1, 2 or 4 people provide crush-resistant protection for your emergency supplies. These kits have a super-durable aircraft grade aluminum frame that can support over 300 lbs, but which weighs less than 9 lbs. This protective frame features a perforated exoskeleton design with secure joints, and chrome-plated screws with shake-proof nylon aircraft lock nuts for extra strength.
These features mean that your emergency supplies will stand a much better chance of making it through a major earthquake undamaged in a MobileAid Emergency Earthquake Kit than will earthquake supplies stored in a regular backpack or plastic bin.
The crush-resistant frame of these MobileAid 3-Day Emergency Earthquake Kits can help get you through the earthquake while these additional features can help you cope with the aftermath until help arrives:
Compact/Comprehensive Emergency kit: emergency–grade supplies recommended by the U.S. Government and numerous others supplies for increased protection and comfort. 
 Quick–access organization: Emergency preparedness supplies are organized in Quick–Response vinyl–lined pouches with carrying straps. This means that you will be able to quickly identify and access your emergency supplies. 
 Easy–roll/flexible transport: dual 4" polyurethane wheels aid in rapid–response and climbing curbs or other uneven surfaces with little effort. In an evacuation, it will be much easier to roll your emergency supplies a long distance than it will be to carry them on your back.
 Seating and gear-carrying platform: allows for people to be seated to rest and can be used to transport additional equipment and supplies (supports up to 300 lbs). These features can be critical if you are left out-of-doors and have to transport additional belongings as you find suitable shelter. 
 Easy identification: highly visible orange bag and flashing (red/blue) LED wheels make this earthquake kit bag easy to find and identify in a disaster.
MobileAid Emergency Earthquake Survival Kits provide superior crush protection, mobility, functionality, organization, and design. All of these features together will allow you to respond immediately, effectively and confidently to a major earthquake and its aftermath.
To help you be prepared for an earthquake, see the LifeSecure full line of earthquake preparedness kits and earthquake supplies.
  If you are helping to prepare a school, workplace, or other large facility, you may need to provide emergency first aid. MobileAid Multi-function Trauma First Aid Stations featured the same crush-resistant frames as our earthquake kits and provide comprehensive trauma first aid supplies that meet OSHA guidelines and ANSI standards. These stations also feature such practical extras as a flexible stretcher and first aid flag.
MobileAid Emergency Earthquake kits and Emergency Trauma First Aid Stations can help you survive by helping your earthquake supplies survive.

USGS Says "Worst Is Yet to Come" in Virginia Earthquake, If it Is a Foreshock


  Head of the USGS (United States Geological Survey), Marcia McNutt, is quoted as warning that the shaking may not be over in Virginia.  She said "What the concern is, of course, is that this is a foreshock.  If it's a foreshock, then the worst is yet to come."  The magnitude 5.9 Virginia earthquake is probably plenty enough already for those who evacuated the White House, Pentagon, and the Capitol.

Twin Earthquakes In Colorado and Virginia Remind Us of the Risks Throughout the United States


 A powerful 5.9 magnitude earthquake in Virgina today follows on the heels of a significant quake in Colorado last night.  These are two regions not used to significant seismic activity. 
 This reminds us that much of the U.S. is at risk of significant earthquakes.  No matter where you live, you need an emergency kit and emergency supplies.   If you live an an area specifically prone to eathquakes, we recommend an earthquake kit specifically designed for such events.    Our MobileAid earthquake kits are designed to protect your supplies from falling debris and then support you in the aftermath.
No matter where you live, let these quakes be a reminder of the need to be prepared for any emergency or disaster.  Make your emergency plan and get an emergency kit today.

5.9 Earthquake Causes Evacuation at White House, Pentagon, and Capitol


 A 5.9 earthquake just hit northwest of Richmond Virginia and caused building evacuations in Washington D.C. at the White House, the Pentagon, and the Capitol.  The tremor was felt as far away as New York City and Rhode Island.
Make sure you have your earthquake kit prepared as much of the United States is covered by earthquake zones.

Two "Real" Emergency Blankets for Real Emergencies and Disasters


 The "mylar type" (space foil) emergency thermal blanket is a staple of emergency preparedness.  We sell them and include them in almost all of our emergency kits.  They are great because they are very compact, help to retain up to 90% of body heat and provide a protective waterproof and windproof barrier.  
I respect these emergency blankets for what they are and the useful (and even life saving) protection that they provide; however, for some time, I have been looking for something more, something better... 
In the aftermath of an emergency or disaster, one often would want a "real" blanket - one that gives comfort, warmth and protection with "material" and not "metal."  The foil-like emergency blankets have their place but just leave something to be desired.  So I have considered adding a "real" emergency shelter blanket to the LifeSecure and MobileAid lines. 
I have looked at small fleece and micro-fiber blankets and found the ones on the market to provide little coverage (some as small as 35" x 62") and therefore lack the ability to provide real protection to other than a small child.  I considered wool blankets, like those used in some evacuation shelters and found them to be too bulky to be ideal for including in an emergency kit.  Also, once they get wet, they have little value in protecting from the cold.  They are really better suited to use indoors - in a shelter - one may not always be so fortunate in a catastrophic disaster.
So I kept looking for a "real" blanket that would be: lightweight, compact and water resistant while providing the warmth more characteristic of a wool or wool blend shelter blanket.  I FINALLY FOUND IT!  In fact, I found what I wanted plus a version that goes beyond my initial expectations and desires to also protect from nuisance and disease carrying insects.
A friend of mine connected me with some folks who have been developing and testing two Apex TechnologyTMemergency blankets for use by the US Military, the World Health Organization (WHO), and other organizations that operate in extreme conditions and provide relief in disaster and other emergency situations.  They have developed two real emergency blankets that we have just introduced in the LifeSecure line...
 LifeSecure Protective Emergency Blanket (Apex TechnologyTM Cover Blanket)  This is a lightweight water-resistant protective emergency blanket that warms and comforts as well as a much heavier blanket while taking only 1/3 the storage space of traditional wool and wool blend shelter blankets. Patented Apex Technology makes this full size blanket (60” x 70”) water, sand, tear, and debris resistant. This ATCB blanket is perfect for your emergency kit because it weighs less than 1 pound and fits tightly in your bag so it takes little space and still provides the comfort and warmth of a much heavier blanket.
As excited as I am about this blanket, I am especially excited for the unique insect repllent version of the same blanket...
 LifeSecure Insect Repellent Emergency Blanket (Apex TechnologyTMCover Blanket with SkinTex®MRIII)This insect repellent emergency blanket designed to protect you from nuisance and disease-carrying insects and the elements after an emergency or disaster.Repels mosquitoes, ticks, ants, flies, chiggers and other insects (including those that carry West Nile Virus and Lyme disease). This blanket is safe for human contact and is 100% DEET free.This ATCB blanket is infused with SkinTex®MRIII, an EPA approved permethrin insect repellent used by the U.S. military and World Health Organization (WHO). Repellancy remains effective for 25 washings.Patented Apex® Technology™ delivers the same comfort and warmth of a much heavier blanket.To protect exposed skin not covered by the blanket, use with an insect repellent approved for direct application to skin.
Look for me post more about these two unique Apex TechnologyTM Cover Blankets as I think they will begin to recognized in the emergency preparedness market as "real" emergency blankets with some real advantages.

What Do You Put In A Tornado Emergency Kit?


 When answering the questions, "What do you put in a tornado emergency kit?", it is important to know that a tornado emergency kit is really just an all-hazards emergency kit.  Your tornado emergency kit should have the supplies you might need after any emergency.  Thus it should be an "all-hazards" kit.  You don't need to have one kit for tornadoes, another for earthquakes, and yet another for floods or some other natural or man-made disaster.
Your "tornado kit" or all hazards emergency kit should be packed using U.S. Government guidelines.  You can find these guidelines at Ready.gov.  We developed all of our LifeSecure emergency kits based on these US Government guidelines.  So the best way for us to answer, "What should be in my tornado emergency kit?" is to tell you what we put in our LifeSecure All-Hazards kits...
 So here are the special features and contents of our 4-Person Roll-and-Go or Shelter-In-Place 3-Day Emergency Kit:
Special Features:

Compact/Comprehensive emergency kit: compact emergency-grade supplies cover all U.S. Governments recommended basics 
Easy-roll/flexible transport:Easy-rolling wheels and telescoping handle avoid back strain; double hand straps and adjustable shoulder strap provide go-anywhere flexibility 
Travel safety and emergency identification:Re-positionable LED safety signal visible up to 800 yards 
Durable protection for supplies: rugged rolling duffel with 600-denier construction; hard-sided cases for personal supplies 
Quick-access organization:large-mouth opening to main compartment with two side pockets and two compression straps; easy-pull ergonomic zippers; personal supplies stored in four carrying cases 
Long life:Water, food, batteries have 5-year shelf life

(4) N-95 respirators (face masks) 
(4) Emergency thermal blankets 
(4) Emergency ponchos 
(1) Roll plastic sheeting 
(1) Roll duct tape 

For turning off utilities and other tasks:

(1) Multifunction tool [needle nose pliers, regular pliers, wire cutter,file/cutter, flat file, pointed screwdriver, mini-screwdriver, small screwdriver, screwdriver, Phillips screwdriver, can opener, bottle opener,punch, knife blade] 
(1) Pair leather-palmed work gloves

For communication and light:

(4) Metal whistles with lanyard 
(1) AM/FM radio with two sets of AAA batteries 
(1) Flashlight with two sets of D batteries 
(8) 12-hour light sticks

(1) Waterproof document pouch

For hydration and nutrition:

(1) 2-gallon water bag for carrying, purifying and storing water 
(4) 2,400-calorie food bar (bar contains 12 individually wrapped 200-calorie portions) [5-year shelf life - U.S. Coast Guard approved] 
(24) 4 oz. emergency water pouches [5-year shelf life - U.S. Coast Guard approved] 
(50) water purification tablets

For medical, hygiene and sanitation needs:

(4) Personal First Aid packet 
(1) Family First Aid kit 
(1) First Aid Guide 
(3) Bio-hazard bags 
(1) Toilet paper roll 
(24) Moist towelettes 

For storage and easy transport:

Emergency preparedness supplies are packed in a rolling duffel with double hand straps and adjustable shoulder strap.

You will note that these LifeSecure emergency kits contain supplies that meet each of the 10 basic emergency needs: water, food, breathing protection, first aid, shelter, warmth, communication, light, tools, sanitation & hygiene.   Note also that this version of our emergency kit has rolling wheels.  We sell rolling and backpack versions of each of our family emergency kits, but we have a preference for wheels (with an option to carry).
 The key is to buy or your own "tornado emergency kit" before a tornado or other disaster actually hits.  It isn't hard to do, but after the fact is... well, after the fact and won't do any good.

What is a Tornado Emergency Kit?


 Many people are asking about Tornado Emergency Kits.  They are looking for a kit that is uniquely designed to deal with the aftermath of a tornado.  The truth is that a tornado emergency kit is really just a regular 72 hour all-hazards emergency kit.  You will have the same emergency needs after a tornado as you may after any other catastrophic natural disaster.
 So our suggestion is that you buy or make an emergency kit that meets the 10 basic emergency needs: water, food, breathing protection, first aid, shelter, warmth, communication, light, tools, sanitation & hygiene.  Your kits should be designed using the U.S. government guidelines available at Ready.gov.  This is how we design all of our LifeSecure emergency kits.
So get an emergency kit - if you want to call it your tornado emergency kit, that's fine.  Then learn what to do in a tornado and what NOT to do in a tornado.  Just remember, when the tornado sirens go off, take cover and be safe.  Don't take chances with something as potentially deadly as a tornado.

What Emergency Supplies Do You Need to Respond to a Tornado?


 Someone recently asked, "What emergency supplies do you need to respond to a tornado?"  The answer is that you need essentially the same emergency supplies that you would need to respond to any other disaster.  If a tornado hits close enough to do damage to your home or knock out essential utilities and services, you may have to evacuate or be prepared to shelter-in-place without the benefit of all of the conveniences which we take for granted.
 Whether you have to evacuate of shelter-in-place after a tornado of some other disaster, you may need to provide for 10 emergency essential needs: water, food, breathing protection, first aid, shelter, warmth, communication, light, tools, sanitation & hygiene.  A well designed 72 hour emergency kit with basic supplies can help you meet each of these needs whether you stay or have to go.
Ready.gov provides a helpful list of emergency supplies.  You can build your own tornado emergency kit or purchase one.

High-Capacity AED Backpack from MobileAid Holds All the Supplies


 Our new high-capacity MobileAid 4-Way Carry AED Backpack has been receiving very positive feedback from medical responders.  The response is strong because many responders want to keep their AED as well as the associated AED supplies and other equipment all in one backpack.  Many smaller AED backpacks just don't have the "all-in-one" capacity.
This MobileAid AED backpack was designed with plenty of capacity to allow for just such an all-in-one storage and response solution.  It has large side pockets for larger supplies and several smaller internal pockets to allow for excellent organization for AED supplies.  The AED itself can be strapped in large internal compartment using three internal straps to hold it tight in place in transit.  The AED pack is large enough to hold any AED on the market that we are aware of. 
Here are the specs:                                                                                                                  External dimensions: (16"W x 19"H x 10.5" D)Internal dimensions (main compartment): (12"W x 17"H x 9"D)2 side compartments: (2"W x 17"H x 10"D)Front access door: (11"W x 16"H)Top Access door: (9.5"W x 7"H)
Not only can it hold a lot of gear, but this MobileAid AED backpack can be carried in 4 ways - backpack, shoulder strap, hand strap, or ride on rolling MobileAid Stations. 
 This rugged AED backpack is made of tough ballistic nylon to protect your AED and take the beating of emergency response service for many years.  The AED backpack comes with either First Aid or Medical Responder markings.

MobileAid Provides 24/7 First Aid for Mississippi River Flood Victims


 We are pleased that the Illinois Law Enforcement Alarm System (ILEAS) chose the MobileAid Mutli-function 24/7 Trauma First Aid Station to help provide first aid for Mississippi river flood victims. 
One of the most unique features of this mobile station is the double flood flashlight system that provides light to first aid responders even when electric light is not available.  This allows the unit to be used 24/7 in a disaster response and recovery situation.  This makes it perfect to aid the Mississippi River flood victims.

Unexpected Deadly Earthquake in Spain Reminds Us That Many in U.S. Live on Fault Lines


 "We know we live near a fault line but we never thought this would happen to us," one survivor said as he dealt with the shock of Spain's most deadly earthquake in over 50 years.  The deadly magnitude 5.1 earthquake in southern Spain reminds us that many of us in the U.S. live on fault lines yet would be surprised to experience an earthquake of any real magnitude.
The Agence France-Presse quotes another survivor as saying, "People are afraid. No one here has ever seen anything like this before."  These same sentiments will no doubt be expressed by millions of Americans at some time in the future as inevitable earthquakes happen in their "home town".  Many in the U.S. live on little-known fault lines.  One of the potentially most dangerous is the New Madrid Fault that will one day create another catastrophic earthquake in the Central U.S. like the quake recorded in 1812.
 What is the lesson?  Learn about your earthquake risk and prepare for a devastating earthquake in your neighborhood.  Learn what to do in an earthquake to protect yourself and have an earthquake kit in case you have to evacuate or shelter-in-place without the necessary basic services that we all take for granted (electricity, gas, water, sanitation, ready access to food, etc).

Terrorist Attacks on U.S. Nuclear Reactors - NRC Demands to See Detailed Response Plans


 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission demanded today that the operators of each of the 104 U.S. nuclear reactors submit their detailed plans to respond to a terrorist attack.  This review of terrorist attack response plans highlights the ongoing safety risk posed by the 104 nuclear reactors in the U.S. 
Terrorism is just one of the threats that share a place on the list of nuclear radiation safety hazards that can be brought on by man-made or natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, and tornadoes.  These last three threats have received recent attention as each has caused nuclear power plant shutdowns in the U.S. in the past few months.
If you live near a nuclear power plant or other nuclear reactor facility, make sure that your emergency kit is up to date and than your evacuation and shelter-in-place plans are well rehearsed.  It just makes good common sense to be prepared for just such a terrorist attack.

Nuclear Accidents in the U.S. - We Are Still At Risk


  The citing of an Alabama nuclear reactor with a "red finding" that indicates a risk for an accident of "high safety significance" reminds us that there is an ongoing risk of a nuclear accident in any of the over 100 nuclear reactors in the United States.  The citation was for a faulty valve that could have kept the reactor from being properly cooled in an emergency.
 It is interesting to note that the same Browns Ferry nuclear power plant in Alabama has been shut down since April 27th because tornadoes cut off external power.  Emergencies do happen and they do impact nuclear power plants.
 If you live near a nuclear reactor, be prepared to evacuate in case of a nuclear accident.

Emergency Thermal Blankets Warm Survivors of Boat Sinking


  I noticed in this photo that the survivors of the boat that sadly sank with up to 600 Libyan refugees aboard were issued emergency blankets like those we use in our LifeSecure Emergency Kits.  These thermal emergency blankets truly can be a lifesaver and are light, compact, and inexpensive.  They reflect back up to 80% of body heat and are windproof and waterproof.
These compact emergency thermal blankets should be a staple in your emergency kit.

You Don't Have to Be A Survivalist to Be A Survivor


 It's true -- you don't have to be a "survivalist" to be a "survivor."   I'm a "survivor" of many disasters, but I'm not a "survivalist."  Though I have learned much from those who are self-identified survivalists and have great respect for their knowledge and skills, I believe all of us as "regular people" can take basic steps that allow us to be a survivor in case of a severe emergency or disaster.
To increase your chances of being a disaster survivor you can:
1) Learn about what to do in various emergency or disaster scenarios.  All of us can identify various kinds of disasters or emergencies that are common to where we live and learn about how to appropriately respond to them.  For example, I live in Illinois and as such should know the basics of what to do in case of earthquakes, tornadoes, blizzards, chemical spills or explosions (freight trains come within a mile of my home), nuclear accidents (we have 11 nuclear reactors in Illinois), and floods.
Such knowledge is readily available on the web (from this emergency preparedness blog among other sources), in books, in pamphlets, from local emergency responders, etc.  You don't need to become an expert in emergency response to learn and remember such basics "Drop, Cover, Hold On" in an earthquake, "get out of your car and into a ditch" in a tornado, or  "have a 72 hour emergency kit in case you have to evacuate or shelter-in-place" in any number of disaster scenarios.
I used to worry about trying to memorize and keep in mind the "10 bullet points for how to respond to each type of disaster".  I have come to believe that one can get and retain most of the "survivor knowledge" they will really need by just occasionally learning about these events and thinking about the key things to do and not do.  A lot of it comes down to common sense once you learn some of the basic principles of response.
When it comes to knowledge of how to respond, you don't have to be a trained survivalist to survive a disaster.
 2) Have an emergency kit and emergency supplies.  As I share constantly in this blog and as the U.S. Government has told us for years now, everyone should have an emergency kit and adequate supplies to last for at least 72 hours (3 days) on their own after a disaster.  Hurricane Katrina taught us that even in America, you can go hungry and be thirsty if you are not prepared to meet your own needs after a catastrophic disaster.
I personally am prepared to support my family's basic needs for much longer than 72 hours, but this minimum is a good place to start.  For relatively little money you can either build your own emergency kit or buy an emergency kit that will meet your basic needs.  Remember, its about "sustaining life" not "sustaining lifestyle" for those few days after a disaster.  Your absolute survival essentials can be fit into one backpack.  That same backpack of supplies can be used to help you evacuate or shelter-in-place.
You don't have to own the ultimate survival knife in order to survive most disasters and emergencies. I love cool survival gadgets as much as the next guy, but basic supplies will do for most scenarios.  Any regular person can obtain an emergency kit that may not contain all the high-end specialized gear a trained survivalist may desire, but that will work just fine to help you be a survivor in a disaster.
  3) Have a basic plan of how to evacuate or shelter-in-place.  If you have the basic knowledge of how to survive a given catastrophic event, and you have the supplies to meet your basic needs for a period of time, you can top that off by thinking through your emergency plan. 
The appropriate response to most catastrophic disasters will require you to do one of two things to avoid harm or to deal with the event's aftermath: evacuate of shelter-in-place.  If you have to evacuate, you'll need to know how you will gather family members, and where you will go before you actually have to leave.  Evacuation can happen in a real hurry in some scenarios and the time for preparation is over when the time for action has arrived.  Plan in advance.
Shelter-in-place plans also require some forethought.  Thinking through your plans will help you better ensure that you have the right emergency supplies in place to respond to an emergency at a moments notice. 
As in other aspects of emergency preparation, your plans don't have to be elaborate.  SEAL Team Six level planning and practice is not necessary.  Just think through the basics and make sure that all family members or colleagues in the workplace know what the plan is.
Following these basic approaches to emergency preparedness will allow you to survive most of what might come at you in this life in the way of emergencies or disasters.  Don't be intimidated by the emergency preparedness process.  You don't need to be a survivalist to be a survivor.

Preparing for the Worst Case Scenario - Catastrophic Disaster


 Prepare for the worst case scenario -- a catastrophic disaster.  This is sound advice. We spend much of our lives preparing.  Most of us spend from 13 to 17+ years in school as a preparation for our life's vocation as well as just for living a productive adult life.  Each job we have prepares us for the next. We prepare for countless specific events in our lives: graduation, marriage, births, moving, etc.  Preparation is part of our daily routine, but how well prepared are we for the ultimate challenge - the worst case scenario?
The worst case scenario may come in various ways.  It may come as a personal tragedy or as a critical accident.  In the unsure world in which we live, it will come to many in the form of a catastrophic disaster.  This may be an earthquake, a tsunami, a flood, a hurricane, a wildfire, a tornado, a chemical explosion, a volcanic eruption, a mudslide, a blizzard, a terrorist attack or any one of many other potential natural or man-made disasters.  My first catastrophic disaster was the disasterous Super-Typhoon "Yoling" in the Philippines that left my family with readily available food, water, or electricity for two weeks.
 Whatever the worst case scenario may be that invades your life, you can prepare for it now. One of the keys to being prepared is to have adequate emergency supplies to meet your own basic needs for at least 72 hours (three days).  It can take at least this long for authorities to begin to deliver aid to most people after a major disaster.  Personally my family is prepared to go it alone for much longer if necessary (remember, I went the two weeks with little help so I have learned by experience that three days is a minimum).
 Because not everyone can afford (either in storage space or cash) to have more than a three day supply, I suggest that you follow the U.S. Government Guidelines and have an emergency kit that can either be used to support you as you evacuate or as you stay put and shelter-in-place.  I like to say that with such an emergency kit "you can evacuate or stay, and you are covered either way." 
 Whether you build your own emergency kit or buy an emergency kit don't delay this important step in being prepared for the worst case scenario - a catastrophic disaster.  Get an emergency kit now and make sure that you are well prepared.  We do live in an unsure world, but we can be more secure if we are prepared.

Bin Laden's Death - NOT an End of the Need to Be Prepared for Terrorism


 While there is justified relief that Osama Bin Laden is dead, the threat from terrorism in the United States and abroad remains high.  This fact has been reiterated time and again in the newscasts of the last 24 hours.  No one is under the impression that the news that Bin Laden is no longer personally a threat, is an indication that the terrorist threats that he came to symbolize in our generation are a thing of the past.  These attacks will go on as carried out by others.
This means that terrorist attacks are among the many threats, natural and man-made, that we still need to be prepared for.  How do we as ordinary citizens perpare for such events?  We prepare just as we would for other catastophic events.  We have an emergency kit and emergency supplies ready to evacuate of shelter-in-place (according to the need), we have a plan as to what to do, and we stay informed both before and after such an event.
Though there are areas of our country that naturally are more likely targets of terrorist attacks,  experience have taught us that no place in our country is completely safe from such attacks from foreign or domestic terrorists.  Therefore all of us should be prepared for the impact of such terrorist attacks.

Tornado Tracks Map


Here is a preliminary map of the tornado tracks in the devastating Southern outbreak of tornadoes this week.  I am amazed at how long many of the tracks of devastation really are.
 Be prepared, and take cover when a tornado warning sounds.

What To Do After A Tornado - How to Be Safe


 What do you do after a tornado?  Here are some tips from the CDC on how to stay safe after a tornado.  One study showed that 50% of injuries happen after the actual tornado, during search efforts and clean up.  A third of the injuries came from stepping on nails. 
Be careful and be safe even after a tornado has passed.

Things NOT To Do in Case a Tornado is Coming


We have all read long lists of things to do in the case of various disaster scenarios. However, it is often avoiding what you should NOT do that can mean the difference between life and death or safety and injury. So here is a list of what NOT to do if a tornado is bearing down on you:
 1) DON'T try to outrun a tornado.  How fast do tornadoes move?  The typical tornado may move at about 10 - 20 to miles per hour, but some tornadoes move at 60 miles per hour or more.  Tyring to outrun a tornado on foot or in a vehicle is a dangerous move.  Instead seek safe shelter immediately.


 2) DON'T stay in a car, trailer, or mobile home (even if its tied down).
  These simply provide little to no protection from the up to 300 mile per hour winds that a severe tornado may generate. Get out, get to a more sturdy shelter, or lie flat (and cover your head) in any depression you can find.  The bottom line is that you will do better in the open lying flat than you will inside what will likely become a projectile or simply disintegrate.  The pictures tell the story best.  
 Oh and don't try to take cover under the car, trailer, or mobile home.  Get away from them so they don't hit you when the winds sweep them away.
3) DON'T stand there watching the tornado or filming it.  Get away from the window. Put the video camera or cell phone cam down and value your life more than you do a few seconds of fame on the internet or with your friends.  Seconds can matter.  If a tornado is heading your way, take cover!  Avoid the deer in the headlights reaction.
 4) If you are outdoors, DON'T seek shelter around trees, vehicles, or other things that can become airborne projectiles. Get to safe and sturdy shelter or lie down in the best gully, ditch, or depression you can find and cover your head.  Things will be flying - even heavy things - so keep yourself as flat as possible.  Flying debris cause the majority or fatalities and injuries in a tornado.  Stay away from things that can blow apart or blow onto you.
 5) DON'T take cover under a bridge or overpass.  The reality is that in a tornado winds can actually accelerate under such structures and the structures themselves can come apart and create deadly debris.  Also, you will probably be violating the "stay away from cars" rule as you will likely have your own vehicle there as well as those of others who did not read this list of things NOT to do in a tornado.
Do you have any "DON'TS" to add to the list?  Please comment and add to my list of things NOT to do in a tornado.
