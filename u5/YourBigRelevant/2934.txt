CLEVELAND,  Ohio -- The earthquake that rattled the East Coast was felt here, 300 miles away.	"I was sitting on my couch, and my cabinet started shaking," said Tilda Freeman of Oakwood. "My dishes were shaking."  
	Similar stories were shared Tuesday from downtown Cleveland to the suburbs through cellphones, emails and text messages asking, "Did you feel it?"  
	"I was eating at a restaurant, and I felt that the table was moving and I saw the windows rattling," said Tom Zdanowicz, 65, of Sagamore Hills. "I got really nervous because I've got family in California and they get earthquakes."  
	Those who didn't get a shake from the quake said they felt left out.  
	The earthquake's epicenter was near Louisa, Va., 27 miles east of Charlottesville and 83 miles from Washington, D.C.  
	Its magnitude was measured by the U.S. Geological Survey at 5.8.  
	Bob Bartolotta, manager of the seismic observatory at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, said that since January 2005, there have been 51 earthquakes in Ohio, and 76 percent occurred in Northeast Ohio.  
However, the last time a 5.0-magnitude earthquake occurred was in January 1986, in Hambden Township in Geauga County.  
	While some buildings in Columbus were temporarily evacuated, very few were evacuated in Cleveland. The press box at Progressive Field shook for about a minute.

	"The interesting thing about this earthquake was the way it was felt," Bartolotta said. "Last year [on June 23] we felt an earthquake originating near the Ottawa River in Canada in the province of Ontario that went side-to-side. This one was different because the ground motion was more vertical, more up and down."  
	The audience at U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan's meeting in Valley View, where he spoke against privatizing the Ohio Turnpike, felt the earthquake while waiting for the congressman to appear.  
	Some people said they felt their chairs wobble but didn't know at first why. Others said they imagined a truck had just driven by.  
	The Ohio Emergency Management Agency sent email messages to emergency center agencies in every county, and 20 responded, said Kelli Blackwell, the agency's spokeswoman.

	"People reported saying they felt buildings swaying," she said. "Other reports said they saw pictures and mirrors moving on walls, but we received no reports of damages or injuries anywhere in the state -- though the quake was felt from Lorain ... down to Cincinnati in Hamilton County."  
	Blackwell also said some buildings in downtown Columbus, including the Statehouse Bureau, evacuated their workers, but only for a short time.  
	She also said nuclear power plants at Perry and Beaver Valley in Pennsylvania, reported feeling the quake but said there was no damage and continued operating at 100 percent.  
	The Davis-Besse nuclear power plant near Sandusky did not send a report, Blackwell said, but a spokesman said they did not feel the earthquake.  
	David Zeng, the head of civil engineering at Case Western Reserve University, said that for an earthquake to cause damage in Cleveland, its epicenter would have to be in the city and be a 6.0 magnitude.  
	In Kent, Donald Palmer, who has taught geology at Kent State University for 38 years, felt the quake, which he said was not surprising. The firm, hard crystalline rock that stands between here and the epicenter does not dissipate energy.  
	"But it is interesting that this quake could be felt more strongly in the Northeast and Southwest because of the structure of the Appalachian mountains," he said. "It was stronger there than in the northwest where we are, but we still felt it."

Including the status of the local power plants is clearly a direct result of the situation in Japan. However, I  feel it is unnecessary for this article since the Fukushima power plant was destroyed by the tsunami, not the earthquake.

the earthquake hit at approximately 1:50 p.m. i was standing in my living room when all of a sudden the walls started vibrating - ever so slightly ,but i was scared enough to leave the house for a few moments. my neighbor confirmed the tremor because she felt the same thing. i don't know how they cope with the constant tremors in japan.

I did feel it - I was sitting in my living room at the time.  A moment later, I checked the time - 1:53 according to DirecTV.  So I anticipated hearing about an earthquake somewhere in the region.  It was very subtle though.  If I had been moving around, I'm not sure I would have noticed.  I'm on the west side - about 15 minutes from downtown.

mikeq--a tsunami is an earthquake under the ocean which has a greater impact, so the Fukushima power plant was damaged by the earthquake which produced the tsunami--a double assault.
