WASHINGTON - A 5.9 magnitude earthquake centered northwest of Richmond, Va., shook much of Washington, D.C., and was felt as far north as Rhode Island, New York City and Martha's Vineyard, Mass., where President Barack Obama is vacationing.The U.S. Geological Survey said the earthquake was half a mile deep. Shaking was felt at the White House and all over the East Coast, as far south as Chapel Hill, N.C. Parts of the Pentagon, White House and Capitol were evacuated. There were no immediate reports of injuries. The Pentagon was later deemed safe for reoccupation.The quake was centered near Louisa, Va., in Louisa County, which is northwest of Richmond and south of Washington.Obama and many of the nation's leaders were out of town on August vacation when the quake struck at 1:51 p.m. EDT. The shaking was felt on the Martha's Vineyard golf course as Obama was just starting a round.The East Coast gets earthquakes, but usually smaller ones and is less prepared than California or Alaska for shaking.At Reagan National Airport outside Washington, ceiling tiles fell during a few seconds of shaking. Authorities announced it was an earthquake and all flights were put on hold.

@bustajones48 btw I know you and robj89 are the same person loser..LMAO.You don't have﻿ hate my ass.AND YOU NEVER LIVED THROUGH 400 YEARS OF SLAVERY NIGGER SO YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP.and go do research every race had slaves, every race in their native land abolished slavery EXCEPT AFRICANS, that's when the white man turned to Africa for labor, cuz everyone else stopped having slaves except blacks.And if it wasn't for the white man you'd still be in Africa living in a hut.

@bustajones48 And you are right blacks are violent monkeys and when a nigger calls me a slur to my face I call them nigger﻿ right back jack.Blacks commit 80% crimes in the U.S.Your niggerish threat proves it.

@bustajones48 Japan and China would nuke the whole continent of Africa if they wanted to.So before you say anything racist get to know﻿ why I don't like niggers.Most blacks well actually all blacks I've met are ignorant, uneducated, racist, useless, beyond despicable creatures.So yes I am judging you on the content of your niggerish character.

@bustajones48 yes just because they white man brought you here and bred you into their culture monkey doesn' t mean you are better than me.Because if it wasn't for slavery you'd still be in Africa dining on raw gorilla dick and dog and rats and all that shit they eat in Africa.But instead you have the pleasure of dining on fried chicken.You know blacks started AIDS﻿ in humans right??How?By eating bush meat (gorilla meat) either that or ya'll humped them.

@bustajones48 Niggers don't like Asians and as an Asian niggers have racially harassed﻿ me over and over yet I have to hear the same niggers complain about fake racism that they pretend to go through so yes I hate niggers with a PASSION.No it was more like your daddy King Kong not Godzilla.Just because the white man brought your ancestors here in chains and tied them so they didn't slip into the water because we know blacks can't swim and whitey bred u into their culture..................
