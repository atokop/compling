Earthquake on the east coast? Earthquake In Virginia?  Making a VLOG can be hazardous these days especially when you live in virginia and you start sitting down and the whole house shakes.  What if the earthquake made the house collapsed on me during this VLOG? The ceiling could have fell through since this earthquake was bad enough. This was a confirmed earthquake which registered a 5.8 to 5.9 I am a Virginia Earthquake 2011 Survivor! Actual Footage caught on cameraIs the world coming to an end? Is this the next sign?Earthquake Felt Across D.C. Region? I felt the floor and the chair and the table shaking. Felt like a train and a plane and thunder near my house all at the same time. Earthquakes need to be taken seriously! If you feel an earthquake be prepared. The pentagon got it bad! 5.9M Earthquake Rocks Virginia East Coast USA Eastern united states 5.9 earthquake hits virginia.The U.S. Geological Survey said the earthquake was half a mile deep. Shaking was felt at the White House and all over the East Coast, as far south as Chapel Hill, N.C. Parts of the Pentagon, White House and Capitol were evacuated. There were no immediate reports of injuries. The Pentagon was later deemed safe for reoccupation.The quake was centered near Louisa, Va., in Louisa County, which is northwest of Richmond and south of Washington.I never panic during these kind of things since it clouds your mind and you are less likely to be able to take control of the situation. Earthquake or tornado, we need to think clearly.Let me know if you had any earthquakes near you and how did you react.

I live in Maryland. We were in Quantico, VA when my folks and I felt it. We visited the US Marine museum there and we were in the building when we felt it. When earthquake happens,﻿ you usually swing side to side or back and forth but dis one was different.

I didn't mean to say this but this video totally made laugh. You were video taping then it's started to rumble and you still had no idea what was going on after five seconds. The earthquake﻿ was scary. It did feel like there was a train coming.

@stinkyfinger5000 I guess you're saying you study the physics and English usage needed to﻿ troll LMFAO it funny that you got on my spelling on the internet.... I must have it a nerve with you. btw, I'm not a troll... I'm more of an "anti-troll" who's willing to comment back to your silly comments. Btw, I've taken ethics and had a mate who studied psychology.... all I gotta say is, you need to work out your loneliness issues and learn to fun things that are actually fun to do. btw no troll page.

@TURKPOPMV Actually I am a professor. ﻿ I teach Physics and English. You should work on spelling, grammar and syntax before you try to be intellectual. I spend a lot of time doing research, composing music and currently we are doing research on obsession. So far the research has came to the conclusion that people who respond to trolls are trolls themselves. Any normal person would over look a rude comment. I bet you have a troll page to, don't you? Its for research purposes. Do you?
