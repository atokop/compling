LIVE - MAGNITUDE 5.9 EARTHQUAKE HITS EAST COAST - USA A near 6.0 earthquake, based in Virginia, hit the US east coast. قوته 5.9 درجة زلزال يضرب الساحل الشرقي -- الولايات المتحدة الأمريكية ---------------- A moderate, 5.9-magnitude earthquake struck near Richmond, Va. Tuesday, causing major federal buildings in the Washington, DC area to be evacuated. There were no immediate reports of injuries or significant damage, yet the quake was felt over hundreds of miles, with reports of shaking coming in from Boston and Martha's Vineyard (where the president is vacationing) in Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New York City to the north and south into the Carolinas. One Twitter user reported shaking north of Toronto. For those of us whose knowledge of earthquakes is based on reports from seismically-active regions like California and recently-devastated Japan, it seems like a paradox. In those regions, a quake felt so far from its epicenter would likely have been catastrophic -- a 7- or 8-magnitude that caused massive damage and loss of life. There is a geological explanation. The Earth's crust beneath the Easter US is older and harder than out West. It has fewer fault lines and far less seismically active -- but when earthquakes do hit, that hard ground is far more effective and conducting the seismic waves. As blogger Kevin Mayeda at OpenHazards.com explains, a magnitude-5 in San Jose, Calif. "would be moderately felt in San Francisco," 45 miles away, with little physical damage <b>...</b>
