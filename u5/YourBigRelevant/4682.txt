footage taken at 8.15am, winds are picking up now. Since I uploaded the 4 videos of Irene hitting Nassau, I've received 825000 hits in 3 days, if everyone donated just $1 to Great Commission Ministries we could make a real difference to the victims who's homes are now in pieces. Nassau missed the hurricane compared to the Southern Bahamas Islands.

BBC News Sunday 28th August 2011 Ferocious winds from Hurricane Irene have begun to hammer New York, bringing torrential rain and the threat of flooding in the financial district. New York City's public transport system has been closed and the mayor said it was now too late for people to leave. Irene has already hit North Carolina and Virginia, causing damage and the deaths of at least eight people. The eye of the storm, packing winds up to 75mph (120km/h), is due to hit New York in the next few hours. The storm has weakened to a category-one hurricane since it came ashore but is still expected to be destructive. About two million people have been left without power as the 500-mile-wide (800km) storm barrelled up the east coast. The same number have moved out of the danger zone, most from New Jersey. At 05:00 (09:00 GMT) the hurricane was moving along the New Jersey shore, about 115 miles south of New York City, having weakened slightly, the National Hurricane Center reported. Some 370000 people living in low-lying areas of New York City had been told to leave, but Mayor Michael Bloomberg warned those behind to stay put.

How Will Hurricane Irene Effect New York City

For more videos visit www.zingmit.com "Your #1 Online source for all your Jewish videos & kosher videos!" Time to think about the unthinkable. What if a major hurricane were to pass close to New York City, as several forecasting models now suggest that Hurricane Irene might? Apart from the inevitable loss of life in the most densely populated part of the country, history suggests that the economic damage could run into the tens of billions of dollars, depending on the severity of the storm and how close it comes to the city. Unlikely but theoretically plausible scenarios could have the damage entering the realm of the costliest natural disasters of all time, and perhaps being large enough to have a materially negative effect on the nation's gross domestic product. Tropical cyclones in and around New York City and the Northeastern United States are fairly rare but not unprecedented. Using a relatively conservative set of criteria, I have identified 20 storms since 1900 that have made landfall north of the Mason-Dixon line with tropical-storm force winds (at least 39 miles per hour) or higher, 12 of which made direct hits on either Long Island or New Jersey. The table below provides several key pieces of data for each storm. First, how close the eye of the storm was to New York City (specifically, Midtown Manhattan) at its closest approach. Second, what the storm's maximum sustained wind speed was at that time. And third, how much economic damage it was estimated to have <b>...</b>

Millions of people are taking shelter along the American east coast. Hurricane Irene is not the most powerful storm on record, but still large enough to cause damage. Eight people have died so far and thousands of flights have been grounded. Al Jazeera's Tom Ackerman reports from where Irene first made landfall - in North Carolina.
