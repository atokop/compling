25 Signs That The Financial World Is About To Hit The Big Red Panic Button

25 Signs That The Financial World Is About To Hit The Big Red Panic Button: "Most of the worst financial panics in history have happened in the fall.  Just recall what happened in 1929, 1987 and 2008.  Well, September 2011 is about to begin and there are all kinds of signs that the financial world is about to hit the big red panic button.  Wave after wave of bad economic news has come out of the United States recently, and Europe is embroiled in an absolutely unprecedented debt crisis.  At this point there is a very real possibility that the euro may not even survive.  So what is causing all of this?  Well, over the last couple of decades a gigantic debt bubble has fueled a tremendous amount of 'fake prosperity' in the western world.  But for a debt bubble to keep going, the total amount of debt has to keep expanding at an ever increasing pace.  Unfortunately for the global economy, sources of credit are starting to dry up.  That is why you hear terms like 'credit crisis' and 'credit crunch' thrown around so much these days.  Without enough credit to feed the monster, the debt bubble is going to burst.  At this point, virtually the entire global economy runs on credit, so when this debt bubble bursts things could get really, really messy..."

FBI, Homeland Security Warn of Small Airplane Terror Threats: "The FBI and Homeland Security have issued a nationwide warning about al-Qaida threats to small airplanes, just days before the anniversary of the 2001 terrorist attacks.


There is no specific or credible terrorist threat for the 10-year anniversary of the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, authorities said. But they have stepped up national security as a precaution.


Al-Qaida was considering ways to attack airplanes, as recently as earlier this year, according to a five-page law enforcement bulletin issued Friday.


The alert, issued ahead of the summer's last busy travel weekend, said terrorists have considered renting private planes and loading them with explosives..."

Cops Confiscate Lakewood Lady’s Arsenal; Motive Pending | Scene and Heard: Scene's News Blog: "Francesca Rice no longer serves in her country’s armed forces, but she brought a piece of the action back home with her.


It seems the Lakewood vet had stockpiled her Edgewater Towers condo with a home arsenal including handguns, shotguns, a sniper rifle — plus a Thompson sub-machine gun, just in case the pizza guy got fresh.


Her cache somehow caught the attention of Lakewood Police, who paid a visit last September. When they found Rice wasn’t home, they asked an obliging employee of the complex to open up the apartment without her consent. Once inside, they raided the gun rack, making off with 13 firearms worth around $15,000. The only problem: They had no apparent reason to.


When Rice kindly asked to have her toys returned, the cops acknowledged that the weapons were legally owned. But they refused to return them without a court order. And so Rice has filed suit..."

Karin Edgett, a Washington DC resident, told the Washington Times: ‘I look at this as the FDA is in cahoots with the large milk producers.

‘I don’t want the FDA and my tax dollars to go to shut down a farm that hasn’t had any complaints against it. They’re producing good food, and the consumers are extremely happy with it.’..."

Nano Patents and Innovations: NASA Sees Katia Become Second Atlantic Hurricane: "The second Atlantic Ocean Hurricane was born today, Sept. 1 as Katia strengthened from a tropical storm in the central Atlantic...


... Katia is a now a Category one hurricane and is expected to bend north-northwest and miss the Leeward Islands. Maximum sustained winds are near 75 mph (120 kmh) with higher gusts, and some strengthening is forecast over the weekend. Katia is still a small storm about 250 miles wide, with hurricane force winds out to 25 miles from the center (35 km) and tropical storm force winds out to 125 miles (205 km).


The National Hurricane Center noted that Katia could become a major hurricane (Category three) over the weekend.


At 11 a.m. EDT on Sept. 1, Katia's center was still far from land. It was about 1050 miles (1,685 km) east of the Leeward Islands, near 15.5 North and 47.5 West. It was moving to the west-northwest near 18 mph (30 kmh) and is expected to slow down.


The National Hurricane Center said Katia is forecast to become a major hurricane on Sunday with winds over 111 mph. It will be between Puerto Rico and Bermuda so NASA will be watching it for the next week..."

Why Texas' Drought May Have Global Effects

Why Texas' Drought May Have Global Effects - TIME: "... Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and New Mexico have been caught in a heat wave that feeds on the drought... As sunlight hits the ground... it evaporates any moisture in the soil and raises the temperature of the soil. With no moisture, the ground is a virtual hot plate, adding to the misery. That misery is bound to end and the last of the year's 100-plus temperatures may be recorded this week, but this drought will have a ripple effect that will spread beyond the region in the months ahead, having an impact on the one place Americans do not need to feel the hurt: their pocketbooks.


From beef prices to the cost of a pair of socks, the Texas drought of 2011 will leave its mark on family budgets... Losses, so far, are estimated at $5 billion. Texas has lost a little over half of its cotton crop as parched fields brought back memories and statistics not seen since the great dust bowl of 1933. Texas produces 55% of the U.S. crop and two-thirds of America's yield is exported to mills in China, Mexico, Vietnam and Thailand..."

Financial Crisis Is Too Big for Developed World to Cope, Ex-IMF Head Says - Bloomberg: "The crisis threatening the global financial system exceeds the capabilities of developed nations and requires a new International Monetary Fund 'debt facility,' former IMF head H. Johannes Witteveen said...

... Renewed signs of economic weakness globally and the downgrading of U.S. debt by Standard & Poor’s have rekindled concern about the quality of government borrowing, especially in Europe. Slumping confidence has wiped $8 trillion from the value of equities in four weeks.

The leaders of euro zone nations have done everything politically feasible to counter the crisis, while the European Central Bank and the U.S. Federal Reserve are close to the limit of their capabilities, Witteveen said..."

Simulation: New Madrid Quake Would Kill 100,000 Instantly; Displace 7 Million

Simulation: New Madrid Quake Would Kill 100,000 Instantly; Displace 7 Million: "If you live in and around Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, Arkansas, Kentucky, Tennessee and Mississippi you might want to consider the following – then again, if you’re reading this web site you probably already have: 


In May, the federal government simulated an earthquake so massive, it killed 100,000 Midwesterners instantly, and forced more than 7 million people out of their homes. At the time, National Level Exercise 11 went largely unnoticed; the scenario seemed too far-fetched — states like Illinois and Missouri are in the middle of a tectonic plate, not at the edge of one. A major quake happens there once every several generations. 

… 

National Level Exercise 11, or NLE 11, was, in essence, a replay of a disaster that happened 200 years earlier. On Dec. 16, 1811, a magnitude 7.7 earthquake hit the New Madrid fault line, which lies on the border region of Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, Arkansas, Kentucky, Tennessee and Mississippi. It’s by far the largest earthquake ever to strike the United States east of the Rockies. Up to 129,000 square kilometers [50,000 square miles] were hit with 'raised or sunken lands, fissures, sinks, sand blows, and large landslides,' according to the U.S. Geological Service. 'Huge waves on the Mississippi River overwhelmed many boats and washed others high onto the shore. High banks caved and collapsed into the river; sand bars and points of islands gave way; whole islands disappeared.' People as far away as New York City were awakened by the shaking. 

More quakes, of a similar size, followed. But the loss of life was minimal: Not too many people lived in the area at the time. Today, there are more than 15 million people living in the quake zone. If a similar quake hit, '7.2 million people could be displaced, with 2 million seeking temporary shelter' in the first three days, FEMA Associate Adminsitrator William Carwile told a Congressional panel in 2010. 'Direct economic losses for the eight states could total nearly $300 billion, while indirect losses at least twice that amount.'

Vermont Emergency Management spokesman Mark Bosma said the helicopters would bring relief to people in a string of small towns where roads and bridges were washed out...


... Officials also used heavy-duty National Guard vehicles to reach communities where roads may be passable.In a disaster that caught many communities off guard, Irene dumped up to 11 inches of rain on Vermont over the weekend and turned placid mountain streams into roaring brown torrents that smashed buildings and ripped homes from their foundations.

U.N. Warns Of Bird Flu Resurgence, New Asian Strain | FoxNews.com: "The United Nations warned Monday of a possible resurgence of the deadly bird flu virus, saying wild bird migrations had brought it back to previously virus-free countries and that a mutant strain was spreading in Asia.


A mutant strain of H5N1, which can apparently sidestep defenses of existing vaccines, is spreading in China and Vietnam, Tthe U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization said in a statement Monday. It urged greater surveillance to ensure that any outbreaks are contained.

Wake Up America! 10 Very Obvious Reasons Why The Devastating U.S. Jobs Famine Is Going To Suck The Hope Right Out Of America: "Do you have friends, neighbors and relatives that can't find work?  Well, unfortunately the current U.S. jobs famine is about to get a whole lot worse.  Right now there are approximately 13.9 million unemployed Americans.  That does not count those that 'are not looking for work'.  That does not count those that are working part-time jobs but that are desperate for full-time work.  The truth is that we need tens of millions more full-time jobs in order to give one to everyone that wants one.  Sadly, the long-term trends that have caused this mess continue to get worse.  Unless truly dramatic changes are made, the U.S. economy is going to continue to bleed jobs and that is going to suck the hope right out of this country.  It is time to wake up America!  It is not a big mystery why we don't have enough jobs.  But sadly, very few of our leaders are talking about the real issues..."
