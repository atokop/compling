Japan Quake And Following Tsunami 03 11 2011 News Feed
by earth on August 26, 2011





 

The most powerful earthquake to hit Japan in at least 100 years unleashed walls of water that swept across rice fields, engulfing towns, dragging houses onto highways and tossing cars and boats like toys. Local media reported at least 32 deaths, with more casualties feared. And the 8.9-magnitude quake, which struck at 2:46 pm, prompted the US National Weather Service to issue a tsunami warning for at least 20 countries. The quake’s epicenter was 373 kilometers (231 miles) away from Tokyo, the United States Geological Survey said. But residents there continued to feel aftershocks hours after the quake. More than 30 aftershocks followed, with the strongest measuring at 7.1. apan earthquake Japan tsunami earthquake caught on tape video Japan video Japan quake oil refinery Japan 8.9 earthquake australia tsunami earthquake today japan earthquake 2011 japan 11 march 2011 Tokyo earthquake japan earthquake today footage tsunami warning mar11 2011 tsunami flood deaths tsunami usa 20 countries

I predicted the increase in earth quakes in my BP spill Carbon Sink end of days bomb Blog. The Carbon Sink means the spill sucked CO2 out of the ATM and into the oceans, sinking the Carbon. The increase in earth quakes now, is earth replenishing the lost ATM gases expelled from the core. Its a natural processes that was accelerated by un-natural means. The BP spill was no accident but done on purpose to fulfill a religious? prophecy AKA the 2012 / End Of Days / Revelations / Glacial Winter.

@xDxRxIxFxTx there are thousands of large ships some even ready for scrap yards that could be used to house all the people and be used as a HUGE HUGE platforms to ferry supplies and power. It was done in Katrina remember? Cruise Ships were used to house people what about large scale cargo nothing wrong with that..Japan and Taiwan has Hundreds of them smart move— in my opinion!.

Japan Government should have built a Great Wall of “Japan” along the eastern coast. If China can build the Great Wall of China manually thousands of years ago only with human labour, Japan can build one earthquake-resistance along the coast with machines & technology. It might cost billions of dollars to build, but can minimise the damage and lost of lives.

Worlwidewakeupcall is right, over the top but right. we are well overdue for some crazy pole shifting and solar flares. as we approach the age of aquarius. (we are in the age of peices, hence jeebus has the fish symbol. probably also why the mayan calendar ends on the date it does. not the end of the world.) gravitic alignments will shift and tectonic plates will be pulled and stretched, charged particles bombarding us because of our weakend shifting magnetic field blah blah you know the rest

@qilinmelb idiot. They died because a building collapsed on them along with a lot of other people. What will you say when you discover some of the 10,000+ people that have died are Chinese. Who will you blame then

@1958Rhonda ASTRONOMICAL events influence Earth events. Understand? I had advanced knowledge of this, PERIOD!!! Ignoring the facts makes you the idiot and proves your ignorance and arrogance. Maybe if you studied astrophysics you might know what you are talking about but you obviously don’t have a clue unlike some of us.

Ya moron actually I DID. I So did my friends who look at and constantly monitor the same astronomical information. I was telling my friends and Family about it 20 + days in advance. Sorry to have to doubt me but this is something I understand on a scientific and prophetic level sorry you don’t believe me, but frankly I don’t give a fuck!!!

@deltaalpha21074 And where are we supposed to move them? The moon? Be rational, here. Cruise ships and cargo ships are almost constantly active on seas. Meaning, using these vessels would be inconvenient for everyone involved in the situation. They are also extremely expensive to run. This diaster was so large, it also punched the United States economy in the face. So any inefficient ways to help would do it’s toll on us. We are trying to help, but no one was ready for this.

@WorldwideWakeupCall agreed..> March 19 ‘Supermoon’ May Cause Moonquakes, Scientist Says- 
 Nolle warns Earth’s inhabitants to prepare themselves during the “supermoon risk window,” which ranges from March 16 – 22. During this time, Nolle claims there will be an increase in supreme tidal surges, magnitude 5 or higher earthquakes, and even volcanic activity. -fox news

OK need about 50 major size Cruise ships to head over to JAPAN and get people out of the Islands and then proceed to  move to fix things up–or at least CARGO ships…some where to move the people to safely.

As a Chinese, I have to thank Japanese government and residents. During the enormous disaster, most Chinese students and workers are safe in disastrous area around Tokyo. Chinese are well arranged by the government to nearest shelters and provided with food and water as reported. Compared to Christchurch, many locals and international students died in the collapsed buiding. I feel shame on NZ government, they respect no lives!

@MsFantasticPlastic Unless ignorant yu well know meteorologists/seismologist cannot prdct quakes. Hence they study snakes, frogs with futility. Well, Christian ‘nobodies’ prdctd Haiti, Argentina-Chile, NZland, Japan, including this channel with irrefutable youtube embedded date before this quake. Inspite of worldviews, With these massive deaths, it is prudent to find out how they knew . “Now I(JESUS) tell you before…that when it come ye may believe that I AM(GOD) he-Jhn.13:19″ SEEK CHRIST

Oh my word. I can’t believe you ignorant sheep. Do some actual research about plate tectonics and about how the world works instead of just following what someone told you to do when you grew up in church. Guess what, science has a basis of fact and research.

@ApocaIypseNow0I2 Quit being smart. The prophecy specifically says North East USA & New York. You well know that earthquakes are extremely seldom in this area. Look at the youtube channel embedded date evidence(5 days before) and quit debasing yourself. Worse is coming. SEEK CHRIST

@HarvestArmy
There are several million earthquakes every year with an average of 1000 of them being major over .5 on the richter scale and there are approximately 500-700 natural disasters recorded every year, at least six natural disasters every year that kill more than 500 people..

@vicentejr28 The news reports are calling it a “major East Coast Earthquake”.  Because it is the highest magnitude earthquake to hit Virginia since 1897, and to hit the east coast in more than 67 years.  Buildings throughout the east coast were evacuated, Flights were delayed, cell phone services went out for hours.  And, it is certainly not normal for earthquakes to be felt in NYC-.even the NYC mayor held a press conference on the matter.  The news reports on the earthquake went on for hours.

Seriously? LOL it’s a natural thing. Plus it wasn’t massive or major. Live in California for the last 30 years and then mentioned to me about massive and major earthquakes. Hilarious
