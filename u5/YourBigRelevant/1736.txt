				How to Predict the Next Earthquake in D.C.

	At precisely 1:51 PM EST, much of the nation panicked, turned to the nearest person, and asked, “Did you feel something?” The 5.9 magnitude earthquake that shook the Eastern seaboard today was the biggest ever to hit Washington, D.C., spanning from its epicenter near Mineral, Virginia all the way to Boston. As we anticipate the inevitable aftershocks
	...More

	 in a state of fear and trembling, the Study asks the question on everyone’s mind: Could we have known this was going to happen? Can we predict earthquakes? ~ Well, we can’t. Despite studying fault lines and poring over historical trends, most scientists are as clueless as the general public at predicting when they might occur. But it turns out there is someone on earth that can predict earthquakes: bufo bufo, the common toad. According to a 2010 study in the Journal of Zoology, an entire population of toads in the throes of mating season abandoned their breeding site five days before an earthquake. The toads were 74 km from the L’Aquila, Italy earthquake when they smelled something funny and scurried away. Picking up on “pre-seismic cues such as the release of gases and charged particles,” the toads were nowhere to be found at a time in the lunar cycle when their site is traditionally packed. All this is to say: If you want to stay ahead of the curve the next time an earthquake strikes, go to the pet shop and get yourself a toad. ~ THE STUDY >> ...Less

	 nerves—from North Carolina to Canada. The quake's epicenter was about 3.5 miles beneath tiny Mineral, Virginia, about 40 miles northwest of Richmond. While the quake certainly created some anxious moments, it was still about a thousand times less powerful than the Fukushima quake in March. So what happened, exactly, and what does it all mean? ~ What was the damage? While structural damage from the quake appears to have been limited, cell phone service was disrupted up and down the seaboard. Yep, cell phone disruption…and that's about it. The absence of mass destruction prompted some Twitter users to make funny jokes about the quake. ~ Okay, so why should we even care? One reason is that nearby nuclear power plants are only designed to withstand a magnitude 5.9-to-6.1 quake, leading the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to shut down at least two Virginia plants even though an NRC spokesman said that "as far as we know, everything is safe." One plant lost power just after the quake and turned to diesel generators for backup. Still, the event raises questions about the safety of nuclear power plants and what the impact of a really big quake could be. ~ Continue Reading » ~ Comments | Post Comment ~      ...Less

	Quake is a first-person shooter video game that was released by id Software on June 22, 1996. It was the first game in the popular Quake series of video games.
Quake was released just as the Internet was reaching maturity, and much of its popularity arose because it was one of the few games of its kind

	 playable over the internet rather than just a local network.
A preview included with id's very first release, 1990's Commander Keen, advertised a game entitled The Fight for Justice as a follow-up to the Keen trilogy. It would feature a character named Quake, "the strongest, most dangerous person on the continent", armed with thunderbolts and a "Ring of Regeneration." Conceived as a VGA full-color side-scrolling RPG, The Fight for Justice was never released.
Quake was given as a title to the game that id Software was working on shortly after the release of Doom II. The earliest information released described Quake as focusing on a Thor-like character who wields a giant hammer, and is... ...Less
