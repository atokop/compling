Share   Email This I know you probably read that title and said “Duh” but I’m serious here. I’ve always known Cantor to be a little prick when it comes to politics, but this new stunt he’s trying to pull has really pissed me off.This week, Virginia experienced a magnitude 5.8 earthquake, one of the most powerful tremors on the east coast since 1897. As Virginians scramble to assess the damage, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-VA) quickly returned from his trip in Israel to survey the damage done to his congressional district.“There is an appropriate federal role in incidents like this,” Cantor said. That role? The bare minimum. According to Cantor, Congress’s traditional practice of providing disaster relief without strings attached — a policy its followed for years — is going way beyond the call of duty. If Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell (R) asks for federal aid, Cantor insists that the relief be offset elsewhere in the federal budget:The next step will be for Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell (R) to decide whether to make an appeal for federal aid, Cantor said. The House Majority Leader would support such an effort but would look to offset the cost elsewhere in the federal budget.“All of us know that the federal government is busy spending money it doesn’t have,” Cantor said in Culpeper, where the quake damaged some buildings along a busy shopping thoroughfare. [...]Cantor did not offer specifics on potential offsets.While touring the damage in his district, Cantor surmised, “Obviously, the problem is that people in Virginia don’t have earthquake insurance.” As the Insurance Information Institute notes, “earthquakes are not covered under standard U.S. homeowners or business insurance policies, although supplemental coverage is usually available.” So, for Cantor, the problem here is that Virginians didn’t have the foresight to predict an exceedingly rare natural disaster and pay out of their own pocket in advance.Are you f**king kidding me? He’s going to play politics with disaster relief funds? This is unbelievable. What’s even more unbelievable is that he’s done it before when Missouri needed emergency funds after tornadoes and that on the heels of Hurricane Irene that is set to hit his own state, he’s saying the same thing againEven as Hurricane Irene bears down on the East Coast – Gov. Bob McDonnell (R) has already declared a state of emergency in Virginia – Cantor is also refusing to pay for hurricane disaster relief unless Congress cuts spending elsewhere. When asked about paying for potential hurricane damage by TPM, Cantor spokesperson Laena Fallon responded, “as you know, Eric has consistently said that additional funds for federal disaster relief ought to be offset with spending cuts. This is infuriating. I mean thank God that Cantor’s view probably won’t stop disaster relief funds from coming to his state if necessary but what a fu**ing douche. Aid can only come if you find offsets in the budget somewhere? Do you know how stupid that sounds? That’s like if I was having financial troubles but got hurt but before I called the ambulance, I went through my budget to find out what meals I was going to cut out to offset the cost of my hospital visit. You don’t hold up EMERGENCY funds while trying to do that. If Cantor wants to offset the costs of disaster relief with cuts in the budget…fine. I don’t agree with that, but whatever. But don’t threaten to hold up funds until that happens. That’s playing with people’s lives. And the longer it takes these people to get those funds and get their lives back together, the longer they’re going to be dependent on the government to assist them. I would think a man like Cantor would be interested in helping these people out as quickly as possible so they can stop “mooching” off the Government.Oh and one last thing. I refuse to believe Cantor really said that bit about Virginians needing earthquake insurance. I need to see a video of him saying it. An audio won’t work because I actually need to see the douchetastic look on Cantor’s face as he’s saying that. Earthquake insurance? In Virginia? Who in their right mind would pay for that? It’s not like Earthquakes are frequent on the east coast. Why would Cantor think that the issue is that Virginians don’t have earthquake insurance? I refuse to believe that even Eric Cantor is that damn stupid.  Article byKriss believes that if uneducated idiots like Sean Hannity, Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh can make a living spewing hateful, untrue fantasies, then damn it…he should be able to be a truthful asshole for a living.  Kriss has been diagnosed with a severe allergy to stupidity and people that irrational decisions.  He likes to point out the fools on both sides of the aisle, be it democrat, republican, black or white…it doesn’t matter.
