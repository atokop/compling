Jackson Heights, NY - Home to Plaza College






Plaza College#  202, 74-09 37th Ave, Jackson Heights, NY  11372www.plazacollege.edu    (718)  779-1430 *** Press Release  ***

The neighborhood of Jackson Heights is situated in the northwest portion of Queens County within New York City. Because of its historic charm, most of the original neighborhood is a National Register Historic District and a New York State Historic Register District. 
The Jackson Heights New York State and National Register Districts range from 93rd Street through 69th Street between Northern Boulevard and Roosevelt Avenue. The area is believed to be the first garden city community built in the United States as part of the international garden city movement at the turn of last century. For years, many families have taken advantage of the multiple groupings of private homes and co-op buildings surrounding the beautiful, secluded private gardens.

The New York City Historic District of Jackson Heights encompasses an area between 76th and 88th Streets, Roosevelt Avenue and Northern Boulevard. Unlike the State and National Districts, the local designation comes with aesthetic protections. Much of the community has late 19th and 20th century architectural revival style, which gives Jackson Heights its distinctive charisma. 

 Jackson Heights has been the home of Plaza College for over 40 years. Known as a cohesive, people-oriented community, Jackson Heights is known as one of the most diverse neighborhoods in the country, being a magnet for people from an incredibly wide variety of backgrounds. 
Plaza College represents the cultural diversity of Jackson Heights and its community. The institution has a tradition of providing students with a quality education that will lead to opportunities for both personal growth and career development. Since 1916, when Plaza College was founded in Long Island City, the College’s reputation for excellence has been well recognized throughout the employer and academic community. 
To meet the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century, the College is committed to building upon its strengths by keeping the Plaza tradition of being a student-centered environment, ensuring the success of each graduate. This family-friendly community, both on and off campus, provides the perfect setting for personal, educational and career growth.

The end of August usually brings the end of beautiful weather; the end of lazy beach days; the end of extensive vacations; and the beginning of school. 
How did you spend your summer vacation? Did you relax on a beach? Or were you too busy traveling the country? Some student’s spent their summer backpacking through Europe while others took a road trip across the US. 
Maybe you didn’t have much time to sit back and relax because you were working this summer. What are you saving up for? Instead of getting paid, some students decided to intern at a prestigious organization or volunteer their time for a good cause. 
However you spent your summer vacation, Plaza College would like to hear about it! 
Please submit a brief description, 2-3 paragraphs maximum, of your summer experiences to PlazaCollegeBlog@gmail.com. Share what you did; what you learned; what you saw, etc. A select few submissions will be featured right here on the Plaza College Blog later this month!

Earthquake Shakes Plaza College






Plaza College# 202, 74-09 37th Ave, Jackson Heights, NY 11372www.plazacollege.edu    (718) 779-1430 *** Press Release ***


At approximately 2:00pm, a 5.9 magnitude Earthquake hit Virginia yesterday, Tuesday August 24th. Although it struck 300 miles away, the entire East Coast shook, including Jackson Heights, New York.
The epicenter of the earthquake was near Mineral, Virginia; about 85 miles outside our nation’s capital of Washington, DC.  According to an article posted by ABC WorldNews, “the pillars of the capital in Washington, DC shook. Alarms sounded in the FBI and Department of Justice buildings, and some flooding was reported on an upper floor of the Pentagon as a result of the quake.”
Plaza College quickly took action and evacuated campus buildings once desks started moving and bookcases began trembling. 
Queens residents spoke to the Queens Courier, reporting their experience with the quake. “I felt the earthquake. It was weird. I didn’t know what to do,” said Lisa Heron of Springfield Gardens. She added that she was “relieved when it stopped.” Another Queens resident from Bayside said he was “sure it was either construction or the train,” (Queens Courier).  
NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg spoke with city police and fire commissioners, and said they’ve activated the Office of Emergency Management’s Situation Room (Queens Courier). Bloomberg said, “Thankfully, there are no reports of significant damage or injuries in NYC at this time… Shortly before 2.pm. we evacuated City Hall briefly, but quickly returned to work. As we await more news from Virginia and elsewhere, our thoughts in NY are with those who were more directly affected by this natural disaster,” (Queens Courier). 
The last recorded earthquake to rattle the Northeast Coast was in November of 2010, when a minor 3.9 magnitude quake was detected off the coast of Long Island from Massapequa to East Hampton.
Plaza College has an emergency response plan to ensure the safety and security of all students and faculty in the event of an emergency, including natural disasters. 
For more information on the earthquake that struck Virginia, click here. Post your earthquake story, including where you were and your experience with it, below or on the Plaza College Facebook page.

 Plaza College# 202, 74-09 37th Ave, Jackson Heights, NY 11372www.plazacollege.edu    (718) 779-1430 *** Press Release ***
Plaza College is known for its small, family like environment. Both students and faculty recognize the unique attention, and describe the relationships in the recent video testimonials posted to YouTube.
The Medical Assisting program at Plaza College prepares students to obtain career opportunities such as a Medical Assistant, Clinical Assistant and Medical Office Assistant. Due to the gradual aging of the population, advances in medical technologies, and the extension of life expectancies, health care employment will be in strong demand.

Matthew Lasalle, a student in the Medical Assisting program, notes his success because of Plaza College in his testimonial. He says the faculty’s main goal is to help you succeed; therefore they have pushed him to do better and challenge himself within the coursework in order to feel well prepared for the workforce. Click here to view Matthew Lasalle’s testimonial on YouTube. 
Asmaa Abbas is another student in the Medical Assisting program whose goal is to attend medical school. She realizes how special the program at Plaza College is offering a GED in medical assisting, which saves time and money. Asmaa also points out how generous and supportive the program is, opening doors and options for their students through volunteer and work opportunities. Click here to view Asmaa Abbas’s testimonial on YouTube. 
Tiffany Graham and Alexandra Palma are both enrolled in the Business Administration program at Plaza College. This program offers students the critical business skills needed to succeed in a position within any type of business organization including marketing, finance, management, technology and healthcare. Through an individualized curriculum focused on business courses, students develop the ability to analyze and solve problems faced by today’s business administrators. 
Tiffany notes the uniqueness of the small, multi-cultural college, allowing everyone to know everyone, and endless help for everything. Click here to view Tiffany’s testimonial on YouTube. Similarly, Alexandra says the personal, one-on-one attention given to each student encourages everyone to succeed. Click here to view Alexandra’s testimonial on YouTube.
All the students, whether in the medical assisting or business administration program, agree that the faculty go above and beyond to see their students thrive. Their warm, caring and compassionate ethics fully demonstrate the family feel Plaza College offers. 
Professor Howle, Director of Alumni Relations also offers a testimonial, claiming that the specific attention provided, as well as the family-like support really adds a personal touch for students.
