5.9 magnitude earthquake strikes Virginia, shaking felt in New York Washington DC An earthquake measuring 5.8 struck the US east coast this evening, rattling buildings in downtown Washington and causing evacuations of buildings as far away as New York. The Pentagon was evacuated after the region's rare temblor, which according to the US Geological Survey had its epicenter near Richmond, Virginia. The main tower of Washington National Cathedral -- the highest point in the US capital -- "sustained significant damage," a spokesman for the site said. "The central tower has been damaged -- it sustained significant damage as a result of the earthquake," Richard Weinberg told AFP in the aftermath of one of the strongest temblors to strike the US east coast in decades. Parts of three of the tower's four pinnacles, its uppermost spires, have fallen off, Weinberg said, adding that the cathedral also suffered "smaller structural damage," notably to flying buttresses and other pinnacles. "Our stonemasons and engineers are working to assess the damage," he said. "No one's been injured, thankfully." The hilltop cathedral is perhaps best known as the site of US presidential funerals. The USGS said the quake's center was 54 kilometers (34 miles) from Richmond, Virginia, and 87 miles (139 kilometers) from Washington. The quake was felt over a wide area, and prompted the evacuation of a number of towers in New York. Click on hotznews.com - FREE to watch 5.9 magnitude earthquake strikes <b>...</b>

Earthquakes jolt Australia, Iran, US, India, and Indonesia. On Saturday morning, July 31 South Australia was shaken by a magnitude-4.2 quake centered 10 kilometers northeast of Quorn, which was preceded by several foreshocks and followed by a number of aftershocks. Meanwhile, a strong 7.6-magnitude temblor struck below the Philippines' southernmost main island of Mindanao early that day. On Sunday, Iran's southern Hormozgan province was rocked by two tremors measuring 3.4 on the Richter scale that occurred within eight minutes of each other in the city of Bandar Maqam. In the USA, a rare 3.0-magnitude temblor hit Louisiana on Tuesday, August 3, while India's Andaman Islands experienced a 5.0-magnitude quake 90 kilometers southeast of Port Blair on the same day. Indonesia was also rattled that day by several tremors, one measuring 6.5 that jolted West Java's Ujung Kulon area, and another of magnitude-5.0 that shook Aceh. Yet another 5.4-magnitude quake was registered on Sumatra's Lampung province in the afternoon, and that evening, a powerful 6.3-magnitude temblor struck in waters off the eastern coast, causing buildings to shake in Manado. There were thankfully no reports of casualties or injuries for any of the events. We are grateful for the safety of the quake-stricken residents as we pray that such disturbances may soon be a thing of the past as we strive for gentler lifestyles to help stabilize our ecosphere.

International recovery efforts continue in Japan. Since the unprecedented March 11 earthquake and tsunami in northeastern Japan, the National Police Agency has confirmed more than 14100 fatalities, with over 13300 listed as missing and an unknown number unaccounted for. Even more than a month after the disaster, aftershocks continue to rock the region, with a powerful 6.1-magnitude temblor striking 40 kilometers east of Tokyo on Thursday evening, April 21. Although buildings reportedly were rattled, there were no immediate reports of damage or casualties, and no tsunami warning was issued. More than 132000 people are still in evacuation centers, mostly in the worst-hit Fukushima, Iwate, and Miyagi prefectures. On Wednesday, Their Imperial Highnesses Prince and Princess Hitachi visited a shelter in Kawasaki, near Tokyo, to offer comfort and encouragement to those displaced by the disasters, including the nuclear crisis at the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) Fukushima Daiichi power plant. As Prime Minister Naoto Kan visited Fukushima Prefecture on Thursday, he stated that the government will begin to enforce a no-entry zone to safeguard the public from radiation in the 20-kilometer radius around the plant. The area encompasses 27000 households in nine municipalities. One member of each household will be allowed to temporarily return to their homes, except for those within 3 kilometers of the plant. Later that day, Prime Minister Kan welcomed his Australian counterpart <b>...</b>
