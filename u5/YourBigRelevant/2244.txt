Reply Freude Bud says: August 25, 2011 at 2:32 pmIf there is any doubt that fracking causes earthquakes, the following FAQ item from the USGS should put them to rest:Q: Can we cause earthquakes? Is there any way to prevent earthquakes?A: Earthquakes induced by human activity have been documented in a few locations in the United States, Japan, and Canada. The cause was injection of fluids into deep wells for waste disposal and secondary recovery of oil, and the use of reservoirs for water supplies. Most of these earthquakes were minor. The largest and most widely known resulted from fluid injection at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal near Denver, Colorado. In 1967, an earthquake of magnitude 5.5 followed a series of smaller earthquakes. Injection had been discontinued at the site in the previous year once the link between the fluid injection and the earlier series of earthquakes was established. (Nicholson, Craig and Wesson, R.L., 1990, Earthquake Hazard Associated with Deep Well Injection–A Report to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency: U.S. Geological Survey Bulletin 1951, 74 p.)Other human activities, even nuclear detonations, have not been linked to earthquake activity. Energy from nuclear blasts dissipates quickly along the Earth’s surface. Earthquakes are part of a global tectonic process that generally occurs well beyond the influence or control of humans. The focus (point of origin) of earthquakes is typically tens to hundreds of miles underground. The scale and force necessary to produce earthquakes are well beyond our daily lives. We cannot prevent earthquakes; however, we can significantly mitigate their effects by identifying hazards, building safer structures, and providing education on earthquake safety. http://earthquake.usgs.gov/learn/faq/?categoryID=1&faqID=1Whether fracking releases pent up energy that would be released later in larger earthquakes is an interesting hypothesis by reader Kevin Smith.  Not sure that that is much of a positive, but sounds plausible. Reply Diego Méndez says: August 25, 2011 at 7:07 amIt’s funny how we European made fun of “eurosceptic” AEP some two years ago.Apparently, British eurosceptics were more knowledgeable about the German character than Continental Europeans, who throught Germany’s commitment to a European Union was for real…I suppose some things are better understood when seen from far away. Reply Kevin Smith says: August 25, 2011 at 7:15 amIf fracking released those earthquakes, maybe that is a good thing, to the extent that it is better to have a series of small quakes than one “big one”.The geophysical energy would have been released sooner or later — maybe it was better to release a bit now, a bit earlier, than would have been the case with no fracking? Reply Susan says: August 25, 2011 at 2:06 pmor maybe fracking will make more earthquakes, and make some of them a whole lot worse. Reply CB says: August 25, 2011 at 7:35 amAnd here we all learned the Grant administration was the standard for corruption.  Reagan’s administration gave Grant’s a run for the money, literally.  But now, ding ding ding, we have a new winner:  the man of no discernible principles currently occupying the Oval Office.  I voted for him because I thought him somewhat better than McCain-Palin, but it’s hard to overstate the criminal damage Obama has done and allowed done.  Only the underclass’ sense of decency and propriety keeps complete lawlessness at bay.  Certainly at the national level, and increasingly at the state level, power makes the law whatever it needs to further entrench and enrich itself. Reply rbm411 says: August 25, 2011 at 7:59 amSurely you jest!  We have a completely lawless political and financial collapse.  Obama “rules us” via Executive Order” and the banks pay fines with money they stole by threatening “tanks in the street.  We are a fascist nation in the strongest sense of the word.

Reply Yearning to Learn says: August 25, 2011 at 8:32 amFirst off: The CounterPunch article discusses the book from the 1950′s called “The Ugly American”.  It’s one of my FAVORITE books ever and I highly recommend that you all read it. of note: it is NOT a dense and boring scathing critique of Americans, it is an easy to read and enjoyable book of loosely connected short stories that discusses what America does RIGHT and WRONG in Foreign Policy… it’s as topical now as it was in the 1950′s.Second: I can’t believe the Schneiderman story doesn’t get top billing on NC.  Yves?  (not that this is a surprise). Reply Yearning to Learn says: August 25, 2011 at 8:34 amsorry, my wording was unclear. it IS a surprise the Schneiderman story doesn’t get top billing on NC.it is NOT a surprise that crybaby Miller is throwing a tantrum. Reply LeeAnne says: August 25, 2011 at 1:17 pm…here you are for the company line:EDITORIALS Prayers at Ground Zero Slapping Schneidermannypost.com/p/news/opinion/editorials 2Mhere Reply Jim A says: August 25, 2011 at 8:40 amIANAL, but it’s my understanding that most of the securitizations were done in New York, under New York state law.  So unless there’s a “Saturday night massacre,” and Schneiderman resigns or is fired, there’s simply no way to give the banks the immunity that they so desire on securitization issues without him signing on.  Ultimately, the robosigning issue IS about what the legal meaning of the “memorilization” of transfers after the fact is.  Were they done “correctly” and do the have any legal meaning at all?  ISTM that me that means that no robosigning settlement is worth much if he doesn’t sign on. Reply CP says: August 25, 2011 at 10:16 amTo be clear, Schneiderman can’t be “fired” (at least until the next election).  He’s an independently elected official.  He would have to be impeached.  Not happening.  I don’t disagree with your fundamental point though.

Reply KnotRP says: August 25, 2011 at 5:57 pmAt this point, he could pay Spitzer himself five grand for a blow job in the public square at noon, and I wouldn’t care as long as it was consensual and it didn’t interfere with going after the fraud. Reply KnotRP says: August 25, 2011 at 5:58 pmFor that matter, even Spitzer is looking like the nearest thing we’ll ever get to a Boy Scout. Give him his job back….he’s angry now, so maybe the revenge aspect will drive him even harder. LeeAnne says: August 25, 2011 at 7:21 pmSpitzer likes girls. Or isn’t that obvious to you. Reply KnotRP says: August 26, 2011 at 2:17 amYour snark detector is malfunctioning. LucyLulu says: August 25, 2011 at 8:27 pmExactly Jim.  Schneidermann holds all the power on this one by virtue of the fact that NY law governs the majority of these bad loans.  If he doesn’t sign on to grant immunity to illegal transfers into/out of the securitization trusts, the entire deck of cards collapses.  Reality is that we have trusts that are empty boxes.What a flippin mess the banks have created.  I can’t believe the banks are balking at the deal.  They should be getting down on their knees in gratitude for the honor to get off with only paying $20B………. instead of serving the hard time which is what I have told my state AG, who remains on the executive panel, I prefer to any monetary settlement. Reply attempter says: August 25, 2011 at 8:54 amRe solutionism:What can the U.S. do to replace the unbridled unilateral solutionism despised by many?  While isolationism is certainly not the answer, America needs to explain its motives more clearly. Also, a bit of Father Finian’s advice to “do what we all agree upon” might help. IOW the solution to solutionism is Better Solutions! (No doubt enacted by Better Elites.)Solutionism is related to and practically synonymous with reformism. It’s the same old astroturfing seeking to perpetuate the status quo.The example quoted is typical – “isolationism”, that is a derogatory term for the abolition of command economy corporatism, is “certainly” not the answer.Well obviously not, to a system corporatist trying to herd people as sheep. And as we saw with the TARP and see everywhere with austerity, doing “what we all agree upon” is an Orwellianism meaning, “what we criminal elites agree upon, and the exact opposite of what humanity agrees upon.” Reply Pwelder says: August 25, 2011 at 8:58 amRe:  Fracking and the earthquakeThat’s a pretty cheesy link.1)  Where, exactly, are the fracking operations in the vicinity of Mineral, VA that we are asked to suspect may have caused the earthquake?  All I see here is some conjecture about operations 160 miles away.2)  If the author doesn’t bother to address this most basic question of fact, why do you wave the article at your readers as something that deserves their attention?Yves, some of your Macondo coverage had real value added.  But you are way too gullible when it comes to anyone who presents themselves as an opponent of fracking. Reply rjs says: August 25, 2011 at 9:22 amyou’re right on one hand, that tying an operation 160 miles away to the quake is a stretch; but on the other hand, the blackpool and arkansas quakes have been tied to fracking…& btw, compliments to the links chef; this bunch really did a nice job of tying the foreclosure fraud / BofA story together; i’m mailing that whole set… Reply Dikaios Logos says: August 25, 2011 at 10:36 amWhile it is conjecture to tie the earthquakes to fracing, it is also naïve to totally discount the connection. The author points us to a number of surprising quakes that have happend suddenly near major fracing operations. There have been questions about human manipulation of water bodies and geology for years: some tied the big Cairo earthquake of the early 1990s to the Aswan High Dam and Lake Naser.The real naïveté is from people involved with fracing who act as if all will be well. A little skepticism in the face of that is a very good thing. Reply craazyman says: August 25, 2011 at 11:15 amI was just talking about this yesterday. I’m convinced that fracking causes earthquakes just based on the fact it see ms intuitively reasonable. It’s like taking all the oil out of yer car, I mean don’t you think the cylinders will seize up?Everything in nature serves a purpose. I bet that liquidy gas is some kind of shock absorber for all those plates in the ground. It’s like fracking your break fluid while you’re barreling down the highway. How is that movie gonna end? Better to just to put up the wind mills and the solar farms and be done with it. already. And energy efficiency too. We don’t need all the power we use. I’d say about half is really needed for the work that’s done. Reply Daddy Koch says: August 25, 2011 at 11:26 amMy compliments on the professional coaching you’ve received as an extractive-industry shill! I note that you’ve taken their good advice to heart with the invariant, “you’re usually good but this story is wrong,” formula. I also admire the facile single detail used to impugn the fracking-earthquake link. Saves time! Keep up the good work, my boy.

Florida froze withdrawals from a state investment fund earlier this week when local governments withdrew billions of dollars out of concern for the fund’s financial stability. In the past few days, municipalities have withdrawn roughly $9 billion, nearly a third of the $28 billion fund (which is similar to a money market fund) controlled by the Florida’s State Board of Administration (SBA). The run on the fund was triggered by worries that a percentage of the portfolio contained debt that had defaulted.” A majority of this paper has The Stink of Bush corruption: Reply Jeff says: August 25, 2011 at 10:29 amEncore!Lest we only blame Obama for anything…http://www.financialweek.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081008/REG/810089997/1036“George Walker is the kingpin in the newly reincarnated asset management firm that’s emerging from the collapse of Lehman Brothers.

Reply Hugh says: August 25, 2011 at 1:06 pmLooking at the links each day is like watching a slow motion train wreck slide inexorably to the bridge that washed out in the last rain.  It all reminds me of 2008.  The stock markets off their highs, sliding around.  A general climate of malaise punctuated by increasingly frequent point crises. Bad policy, no policy, and an ongoing refusal to take seriously the deteriorating fundamentals.In the US, you have BoA on the ropes, reminiscent of Lehman, austerism, and a still unresolved or even addressed mortgage and banking mess.  In China you have bubbles and the prospect of collapsing export markets.  In Europe, we are witnessing its financial and political unraveling.2 1/2 years ago I predicted a crash for this year based on a failed recovery and a failed political process.  I think the highest probability for such a crash remains in the September-October period.  Right or wrong, at this point, it doesn’t take much to recognize that we are in an extremely dangerous period.
