The Hub of the Universe





Most humorous comment about yesterday's magnitude 5.8 Virginia-centered earthquake, from Boston's Peter Shelley on Facebook:
"For all my friends who are worried about me, I rode out the big quake at my desk.  It interrupted my afternoon nap."
Comment:  "Where are you?"
Reply:  "Home now, recuperating."
Comment:  "I hope you are feeling better."
Reply:  "Just a little shaken up.  It'll pass soon."
Classic Boston-centered headline (from Boston.com):
 
The Washington Post was nicely descriptive in its coverage:
The first warnings of the earthquake may have occurred at the  National Zoo, where officials said some animals seemed to feel it coming  before people did. The red ruffed lemurs began “alarm calling” a full  15 minutes before the quake hit, zoo spokeswoman Pamela Baker-Masson  said. In the Great Ape House, Iris, an orangutan, let out a guttural  holler 10 seconds before keepers felt the quake. The flamingos huddled  together in the water seconds before people felt the rumbling. The rheas  got excited. And the hooded mergansers — a kind of duck — dashed for  the safety of the water.
For people, it was a lovely, sparkling  day for an emergency evacuation. Much of the capital’s workforce had  gathered on sidewalks by 2 p.m. The federal government later urged  agencies to send non-emergency workers home.
