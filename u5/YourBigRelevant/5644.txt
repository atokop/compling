Hercolubus Nibiru Planet X Blogspot Warned Japan


Posted: Mon, 05 Sep 2011 21:42:46 +0000
 

Japan’s 8.9 earthquake “historic” says geophysicist. March 11, 2011. As Hercolubus approaches us the Nature warns us. Before yesterday and just yesterday we warned in this blog that media did not inform but something great was going to happen in Japan, well you see what is happening today: “Japan’s earthquake will be considered a great quake,” said Dale Grant, a geophysicist with the US Geological Survey in Golden, Colo. “Japan has never seen this before.” Any quake above an 8 in magnitude is considered a great quake, Grant said. Damage can span from hundreds to thousands of miles. The quake was centered about 80 miles east of Japan. As of 3 am, there were at least 12 aftershocks following the earthquake, with the highest aftershocks measuring 7.1 and 6.8, Grant said. A great tsunami was triggered by the quake. And this is unfortunately only the beginning, because as Hercolubus gets closer, greater earthquakes and tsunamis are going to happen worldwide. planetx-hercolubus-nibiru.blogspot.com

Up to 200 people were feared dead after an earthquake hit New Zealand in one of the worst natural disasters in the country’s history. The powerful 6.3-magnitude quake struck about six miles outside Christchurch during lunchtime rush hour in the country today, causing widespread destruction and injury. Eyewitnesses said the three-mile deep tremor — believed to be an aftershock from a 7.1 magnitude earthquake last September — levelled high-rise buildings, tore up pavements and sprayed rubble onto the streets below. Twitter was awash today with theories that the bizarre deaths of more than 100 stranded pilot whales in New Zealand may have been a warning that an earthquake was going to hit. There have been TWO mass whale deaths on NZ’s South Island in less than three weeks. In the latest bizarre incident on Sunday, less than 48 hours before the earthquake hit, a pod of whales beached themselves near Cavalier Creek on Stewart Island. www.mirror.co.uk

Ninety oil workers have been evacuated from a North Sea rig as engineers fight to control a huge build up of pressure in a well which critics say has the potential to blow-up the platform and cause a major environmental problem. The hole will continue to increase in size allowing more and more oil to rise into the Gulf. After several billion barrels of oil have been released, the pressure within the massive cavity five miles beneath the ocean floor will begin to normalize. This will allow the water, under the intense pressure at 1 mile deep, to be forced into the hole and the cavity where the? oil was. The temperature at that depth is near 400 degrees, possibly more. The water will be vaporized and turned into steam, creating an enormous amount of force, lifting the Gulf floor. It is difficult to know how much water will go down to the core and therefore, its not possible to fully calculate the rise of the floor. concen US Senate votes YES, the ‘People’ have to pay for oil …

7/29/2011 — VISIBLE SATELLITE PROOF of plumes from Volcanic fields = USGS epic fail


Posted: Mon, 05 Sep 2011 11:54:37 +0000
 

It appears the USGS has made a critical blunder yet once again.. Today, the USGS issued a SECOND statement regarding the Pisgah/California volcanic plumes…. get ready for it …. they said there were NO VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGES of the plumes !!! To top it off.. they then said there was NO SEISMIC ACTIVITY IN THE AREA to indicate a threat !!! (we have video shots of the actual EQ charts which contradict these clear falsehoods, there was a 6.0 south of the area, and this video settles it once and for all .. there ARE visible cloud satellite images) We have a several VISIBLE SATELLITE SHOTS of the plume activity ==== and , those shots were in our videos originally, which means they didn’t even watch our videos before responding…. otherwise, they wouldn’t make such a clear LIE such as this….. quote USGS today: “USGS volcanologists evaluating the situation find nothing to indicate that the NEXRAD feature results from volcanic activity. Satellite images from the same period do not show the steam or ash clouds that accompany volcanic activity, and there is no seismicity in the vicinity indicative of volcanic unrest/eruption. No earthquakes were located within 20 miles of LLVF during the last week (USGS-Caltech Seismic Net update 14:10 PDT July 27, 2011 ). No reports of eruptive activity have come in from ground observers (LLVF is within 2 miles of Interstate 40) or from regional pilots (Barstow Daggett County Airport is within 10 miles of LLVF). ” screenshot captures done …

Radiation up 400 times in Miyagi, new blast feared at Fukushima


Posted: Mon, 05 Sep 2011 08:00:20 +0000
 

Follow latest updates at twitter.com and www.facebook.com Japanese police say the death toll following Friday’s mega-quake and tsunami has now exceeded 1000 people. But fears remain it’ll easily be 10 times that. It all comes amid warnings of new threats in the country. Officials fear there’s a risk of another explosion at the Fukoshima power plant but remain confident it can withstand the blast like the first reactor did on Saturday. The government is also saying that a second reactor in Fukushima could be experiencing a partial meltdown. Meanwhile, radiation has increased 400-fold in the region of Miyagi which lies dozens of kilometres further north. It’s not clear at the moment if the radiation came from the local nuclear plant or drifted up from the facility in Fukushima following Saturday’s explosion. Officials claims the radioactivity released so far does not pose a threat to human health. Having said that, the number of people admitted to hospital suffering exposure is said to be rising amid a series of aftershocks that continue to rock the country. The Japanese Prime Minister has been addressing the situation and he said that 12000 people have been rescued so far. He called it was the hardest time for the country since World War II. Meanwhile the emergency services are on high alert in Russia’s Far East.
