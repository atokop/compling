Obama: "Earthquake in Virginia the result of the Bush fault line failure"





The Bush fault You knew it was only a matter of time before Barack Obama somehow managed to pin the cause of the 5.8 magnitude Virginia earthquake on the Bush administration. And then take credit for the fact that damage and injuries were as minimal as they were.

Important Quotes

"I cannot recall at any time when the gap between the kind of words which statesmen used and what was actually happening in many countries was so great as it is now. The habit of saying smooth things and uttering pious platitudes and sentiments to gain applause, without relation to the underlying facts, is more pronounced now than it has ever been in my experience.”-- Winston Churchill"That government is best which governs the least, because its people discipline themselves."-- Thomas Jefferson"History does not long entrust the care of freedom to the weak or timid."-- Dwight D Eisenhower“There are two ways to conquer and enslave a nation. One is by the sword. The other is by debt.”-- John Adams
