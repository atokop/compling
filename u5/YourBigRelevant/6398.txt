					 People along the East Coast weren't the only ones to feel the 5.8-magnitude earthquake Tuesday, as zoo animals in Washington, D.C., let it be known they felt the vibrations, zoo officials said. Some of the animals at the Smithsonian’s National Zoological Park even shouted alarm calls or ran up trees seconds before the rest of us . About 5 to 10 seconds before , an orangutan named Kyle and a Western lowland gorilla named Kojo, abandoned their food and climbed to the top of the treelike structure in the Ape House exhibit. The prequake jitters are not uncommon among animals, with stories and even some science to...

The Fool Lyrics: It's All Over Now, Baby Blue (Bob Dylan) You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last. But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast. Yonder stands your orphan with his gun, Crying like a fire in the sun. Look out the saints are comin' through And it's all over now, Baby Blue. The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense. Take what you have gathered from coincidence. The empty-handed painter from your streets Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets. This sky, too, is folding under you And it's all over now, Baby Blue. All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home. All your reindeer armies, are all going home. The lover who just walked out your door Has taken all his blankets from the floor. The carpet, too, is moving under you And it's all over now, Baby Blue. Leave your stepping stones behind, something calls for you. Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you. The vagabond who's rapping at your door Is standing in the clothes that you once wore. Strike another match, go start <b>...</b>

Party Animals takes a look at Westminster from the ground up - the young researchers and advisors shouldering huge responsibility in a frantic, high-stakes world.

Australia is famous for its wonderful wildlife. Kangaroos, koalas, emus, and crocodiles. But its wildlife is much more diverse than many people realise. While we are all familiar with the icons, many people fail to be aware of the amazing array of Australia's Mini Marsupials, the numbat, the chuditch, the woyly and the honey possum to name a few. But these tiny marsupials are under threat of extinction from land degradation and from feral animals. Australia has the worse record of native flora and fauna extinction in the world. 95% or arid zone animals have disappeared. The reason uncontrolled land clearing. Many conservationists point accusing fingers at Brazil and Indonesia for their so called reckless attitude to forest degradation but Australia is up there with the worst of them, uncontrolled land clearing is as bad if not worse than anywhere else in the world. Add to this the incredible threat to endangered species of introduced predators like the fox and cat and the result is mass destruction of native animals. It is estimated that some 36 billion small animals fall victim to feral cats and foxes every year. But there are those who are acting to save these Mini Marsupials before it's too late. In this programme we see the beautiful but fragile honey possum, the only possum to live solely on the nectar . For the first time, using infra red cameras we se what these mini marsupials get up to when they think no one is watching. We see the woyly that can eat plants that <b>...</b>

Deep in the heart of Papua New Guinea lies a species-rich rainforest, while its coast is fringed with rare unspoilt coral reef. Both areas provide habitat for some extraordinary creatures who face an uncertain and bleak future --extinction. For centuries this forgotten paradise has been hidden from the eyes of the industries that have left such a devastating mark on similar treasures, but that is no longer the case. Pollution, hunting, mining and logging pose real and immediate threats to these habitats. We take a look at what is being done to save these creatures and the world they have inhabited for so long. It is a rare opportunity to see some of nature's best-kept and most enchanting secrets, including the tree kangaroo, the long-beaked echidna, the cassowary as well as the rich marine life. Watch as we meet the remarkable individuals and organisations dedicated to giving the species of Papua New Guinea a fighting chance at survival... before it's too late.

In the European country of Denmark, a strange partnership is being forged, a most unusual alliance which may herald an international movement to help save wildlife. The Danes believe they have the answer, and now the huge tracts of land previously reserved purely for military training -- the business of death -- have acquired a new purpose -- protection of life -- the Nation's wildlife species. Join us on an action-packed trip to Denmark to see the army in action -- on the defence and protecting the environment. As we are introduced to the Danish Military Environmental Protection Schemes, we can see how much protection has gone into the environment, and how much this has saved important Danish endangered species.

This documentary follows a group of animal rescue volunteers as they travel to overcrowded rural animal shelters in West Virginia and Kentucky to rescue dogs before they are euthanized. NOTES: This film was born back in 2007 when after doing my first few packages as a freelancer for Classroom Close-up, NJ, I started looking for an independent project I could tackle on my own. I had recalled seeing this page about Marianne's "Pet Projects" on her website (www.amp-your-biz.com ) and thought there might be an interesting story to tell in the world of dog rescue. It was certainly a new world to me, I'd never even owned a dog. Marianne and I ran the idea around a bit, pitched it to Rogers' Rescues (www.rogersrescues.com), and in a few weeks I was shooting the first tapes of b-roll at a pet adoption event in PA. Most of the additional shooting happened that same fall including the Shelter Run segment where I was able to travel along on a three day dog transport. Due to scheduling and project conflicts it ended up taking almost a year to get some sit down interviews done with the gang from Rogers. Other than some small pickups and b-roll shots, shooting completed in the fall of 2008. The first rough cut was finished in early 2009. Then, it spent another year being polished, reviewed, and sitting on the shelf while paying projects took priority. It started to take final shape early this year and Marianne was actually able to show the rough cut to some rescue folks at a football <b>...</b>

We all know of the Amazon rain forest. But there was once another great forest in Brazil the Atlantic Rain Forest. Today there's only 2% of it remaining and the mini monkeys that once lived there are struggling for survival. When you talk of Brazil's wildlife you tend to think of the Amazon rain forest. But few peole realise there is, or was once another forest just a big and just as bio diverse. The Atlantic rain forest. It strech for more than 1000 miles along the Atlantic coast and inland to the eastern boarders of Brazil. Today there is less then 2% of the amazing forest and the wildlife that used to exist there is albut gone. Those species that remain are fighting for survival, teetering on the edge of extinction. Species like the Golden Lion tamerine, the Wooley Spider Monkey, and many many more. In this episode of Before It's Too Late we look at the many Mini Monkeys of Brazil who are fighting for surtvival. Unfortunatley history is about to repeat itself. Because we have failed to learn from our mistakes of the past. Because what happened to the Atlantic forest is happening to the Amazon. We meet the people in the south of the country who are battling to save the Golden Lion tamarines, and the Wooley Spider monkey. We see wonderful vision of the animals in the wild. But many of the tamarins weren't born in the wild they were born in zoos around the world and shipped back to re populate the forest. We see them being taught how to suvive in the wild.

Earth is a restless planet the restlessness turns deadly occasionally. Of all natural hazards, earthquakes are the most feared. For centuries scientists working in seismically active regions have noted premonitory signals. Changes in thermosphere, Ionosphere, atmosphere and hydrosphere are noted before the changes in geosphere. The historical records talk of changes of the water level in wells, of strange weather, of ground-hugging fog, of unusual behaviour of animals (due to change in magnetic field of the earth) that seem to feel the approach of a major earthquake. With the advent of modern science and technology the understanding of these pre-earthquake signals has become stronger enough to develop a methodology of earthquake prediction <b>...</b>

The Animals were an English music group of the 1960s known in the United States as part of the British Invasion. Known for their gritty, bluesy sound and deep-voiced frontman Eric Burdon, as exemplified by their signature songs "The House of the Rising Sun" and "We Gotta Get Out Of This Place", the band balanced tough, rock-edged pop singles against rhythm and blues-oriented album material. The Animals underwent numerous personnel changes and emerged as an exponent of psychedelic rock before dissolving at the end of the decade.

This video seems to have disappeared. There is another version of this with a 50 second introduction here: www dot youtube dot com/watch?v=TpNWSW49IBM . But the version I'm uploading does not have the introduction. Until viewing You Tube I was not aware of Eric Burdon and The Animals, I had heard their songs, but didn't know who sang them. It's not a good idea for You Tube to remove these videos since they are a form of marketing and they make people aware of these artists. For example I just bought the 2 CD set "The Complete Animals [Extra Tracks] [Import]" from Amazon. They contain 41 tracks, the complete recordings made with Mickie Most as producer. Some of their future songs are not included since Mickie Most was not the producer at that time. Wouldn't have bought these CDs had I not learned about Eric Burdon and The Animals from these You Tube videos.

FROM THE BRINK OF ETERNITY looks at what indigenous people of Kenya, the Seychelles and Mauritius are doing to save their endangered species. In Kenya the film looks at how the growing elephant population is threatening the future of the Amboseli National Park. Once hunted to near extinction the elephants are now so numerous they have almost destroyed the park, by uprooting thousands of acacia trees, thus endangering every animal in the park. We speak with the Kenyan Wildlife Service about a plan to plant one million trees. In the Seychelles we see the world's most erotic plant the Coco De Mar. During the last three hundred years it's erotic and mysterious nuts were washed up on shores around the world. When explorers found their source the nuts were harvested, and thousands of the trees where destroyed to keep the nut's value. We also see one of the word's rarest birds the Magpie Robin (just 30 birds left) as well as other endangered birds and animals. We speak with the Seychellous about their efforts to turn the tide of extinction. In Mauritius we see the world's rarest bird, the Echo Parakeet (just 17 birds left), as well as the world's rarest tree, there is only one left. We have all heard the expression " as dead as a Dodo". The Dodo comes from Mauritius and is the symbol of extinction. We see what the Mauritius people are doing to save their very special species. In particular we hear of one amazing success story.

Hawaii is one of the most beautiful, captivating and isolated chain of islands on earth. Born of ancient volcanoes, burning lava is still molding this Pacific paradise. This unique region is a playground for the rich and famous, and is visited by nearly seven million tourists every year. But one of the most sought-after tourist destinations in the world is paying a high price for its popularity. Just below the Archipelago's beautiful surface lies a tragic fact, that many of Hawaii's unique plants and animals are under threat from habitat destruction, development, pollution and perhaps worst of all, alien pests. Today, with so many native species struggling for survival, this paradise has become known as the endangered species capital of the world. Episode 13 of Before It's Too Late takes viewers on an unforgettable journey to some of Hawaii's most spectacular islands to meet some of the rarest and most critically endangered creatures on the planet. We investigate a gruesome disease killing the region's ancient green sea turtles, and look at the work being done to try to find out what's causing this mysterious plague. We also meet one of the world's rarest marine mammals -- the Hawaiian monk seal and in a magical moment, witness the birth of a seal pup. From below the waterline, to one of the tallest mountains in the world, viewers will see the struggle many Hawaiian species face and meet the determined human helpers who are acting, before it's too late.

At Pengersick , Britain's most haunted castle, they encounter a strange voice speaking from beyond and capture ghostly Orbs on their infra-red stealth cameras. They join a team of psychics as they try to contact Britain's last bear and meet a woman who has communicated with her dead animal companions. Do animals have souls?
