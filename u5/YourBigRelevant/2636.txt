Virginia Earthquake 2011: USGS Warns it May be a Foreshock





Well, that would be terrible...but it cannot be ignored when an official source is saying it. Here's more.

"A 5.8 magnitude earthquake centered in Virginia rocked the Mid-Atlantic, sending shockwaves up and down the East Coast through Washington D.C., New York City, and up all the way to Concord, N.H., and Toronto, Canada. According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the quake happened at 1:51 p.m. at a depth of 3.7 miles. The quake was centered 27 miles east of Charlottesville, Va., near the town Mineral in Louisa County. The movement lasted for no more than 30 seconds. Minutes after the quake, the director of the USGS, Marcia McNutt -- who watched objects falling from the shelves in her office -- cautioned that the shaking might not be over. "What the concern is, of course, is that this is a foreshock. If it's a foreshock, then the worst is yet to come," McNutt told The Washington Post."

What I find ironic is that the east coast experienced a good-sized a quake before the west coast did, where all the faults are. But Jesus said there shall be earthquakes in diverse places, in the Tribulation. (Mt 24:7). He also said that the days before His coming will be like the Days of Noah, when they were all eating and drinking and marrying and giving in marriage, building and planting...unsuspecting of the judgment soon to come. (Mt 24:37). Not that there were no warnings, Noah's 100 years of preaching and the ark itself were a big clue. But they ignored it, mocked and scoffed, just as they will in the last days. "First of all, you must understand that in the last days scoffers will come, scoffing and following their own evil desires" (2 Peter 3:3).

It will be the same once again. The time just before Jesus Second Coming will come after a period of inexpressible tumult and natural disasters, and yet they will ignore them as warnings and judgments. How much more easy is it today to ignore the warnings a graceful God is sending. Pretty easy.

A commenter made an observation in the last entry I'd published about the twin quakes on Aug 23 in CO and DC. Anonymous said, " A newscaster made a comment about the DC quake that since there was no real damage every thing has gone back to "normal". One newscaster who experienced it was even talking about the earthquake excitedly like something cool had happened. It will be nothing more than one of many topics on facebook, twitter posts and water coolers around America. I know this is an understatement but the world is going to get blindsided by the coming time of Judgement."

Very true words.

As for the mocking and scoffing of God's warnings, Isaiah said, "Now stop your mocking, or your chains will become heavier; the Lord, the LORD Almighty, has told me of the destruction decreed against the whole land." (Is 28:22)

I know it sounds so weird to say this, but I can't help but think of how many bizzare natural disasters have fallen upon our country as we have boldly turned our backs on God, and His people.This quake hitting there, to me seems so symbolic. It seems like a gentle warning. A wake up call. I have to say, I check your blog everyday and I am stunned right now at how much our world has changed in the last five years or so. There is literally story after story every day, that shows us that we are very very close to the Lord's return.He is interacting in our world in a mighty way. May we all be like Noah, faithful to warn everyone of the coming judgment. It is crazy to me too, that the Father knows the day. I wonder if He is excited to call us to Him as we are to hear it.

My very first thought when reading the USGS page - is this a foreshock??  Colorado had a nice sized forshock at 4.6 before the 5.3.  I'll be checking the USGS page often today and tomorrow!I also wonder about the New Madrid fault along the Mississippi River valley....

It's hard to believe what so-called "Progressive Christians" are saying about the Virginia quake.

Wow.  That seems to be my most typical reaction lately to your posts and the news... Just "wow."  It sums it all up, really....I agree with the first Anonymous post, about how this quake was like a gentle warning.  It's significant to me that there were no major injuries but it was felt in so many places.  I know the rock here is differentthan out west and it affects how it is felt, but hey, God knows that better than we do! I'm eagerly waiting for our Groom!  The most anticipated day of my eternal life is to be face to face with Him.  And may I just say, while I'm so excited to be with ALL of our brothers and sisters in the presence of God, I have a special excitement to meet and have perfect fellowship with all of my virtual brethren-- like you, Elizabeth!  What an experience that will be!

You know those strange sounds you have been writing about? Have you seen this from Monday night during a baseball game? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5YjbQFIIVs&feature=player_embeddedcould this be connected to the earthquake on the east coast?

Okay, I just posted about the baseball game sounds. And I found this:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AVHXMLDvWAIt is the sound of the earth from space.Is it possible that as the veil begins to lift we are hearing the actual groanings of the earth? "For we know that the whole creation groans and labors with birth pangs together until now." Romans 8:22Or the sound of the sins crying out? If we are almost to the time of judgment, what if the blood is crying out? "And He said, "What have you done? The voice of your brother's blood cries out to Me from the ground." Genesis 4:10. Now of course God knew that Cain killed Abel, but He says that Abel's blood cried out to him from the ground. Now I am sure that that is poetic, but what if it is literal too? I looked it up in Hebrew and that is what it literally means. And it is translated the same in every version. That doesn't necessarily mean that any human could hear it. But what if the blood of the innocent cries out to God from the ground still? How much blood would that be?Numbers 35:30-34 repeats this idea. It talks about how murder defiles the land. "So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye [are]: for blood it defileth the land: and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it."I looked this up in the David Guzik commentary and he says, "Unjudged murders defile a nation. When murderers are not brought to justice, there is a blot on a nation that only the severe judgment of God can cleanse. The United States of America - particularly in its inner cities - is a defiled land. That nation has long been polluted by the stain of unpunished murders. In a recent year in Los Angeles County, they averaged more than five murders a day, and very few of them were brought to justice. The blood of the slain cries out before God."On top of these murders we have a long history of wicked bloodshed, human sacrifice, passing children through the fire of Molech, the holocaust, mass genocide, abortion, etc. God knows each and every human that has been offered on the altars of greed, power, hate, and convenience.Oh, how we need the blood of Jesus! We are all guilty. And yet it blows my mind that the Lord provided for our cleansing in the blood of One. Jesus' blood is strong enough to cleanse us from our own defilement, our own stained hands.  Now I don't know what this sound is. I don't know if it is the sound of the earth groaning in birth pangs or if it is the blood of the innocent crying out for justice, or if it is any of a number of other things. But I do think it is very interesting in light of scripture and all the other crazy things happening in our world today.And yet our culture is insane. Like Lady Macbeth, we want to erase our own sins, to pretend like we are not guilty, and we are going mad. "Out, damn'd spot! out, I say!—One; two: why,   then'tis time to do't.—Hell is murky.—Fie, my lord, fie, a soldier, andafeard? What need we fear who knows it, when none can call ourpow'r to accompt?—Yet who would have thought the old man tohave had so much blood in him?"Act 5 Scene 1

Hi Anonymous,Thanks for the link to the weird sounds. I saw the Rays clip and heard the sound last night and stated preparing a blog entry but then stopped. An update to the story is that it was feedback thru the speakers from a lightning strike. Could have been. Or not.I just don't know what to make of the noises. Many have logical explanations, others don't. The fact that a spate of them is occurring is interesting, but what does it mean?I try to resolve issues here, not add to the general confusion. With little more to go on, and no biblical verses that address such noises, I refrain from writing more...because, what could I say? The notion you put forth, that it is the world's sins crying out is a good an explanation as any. They may indeed be a manifestation of the creation groaning toward redemption. (Romans 8:22)

OK I'm not joking when I say i heard something similar to the sound in that baseball video about 30 minutes ago. I live in Houston. There are storm clouds/lightning but no thunder (Lord, have mercy on us and let it rain!) around but it was a very loud whooshing sound just like that that I've never really heard before. I asked my mom if she heard it and she just commented that it was probably a plane. It did not sound like a plane. Now I'm really hoping it was a plane!

"For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall always be with the Lord. Therefore comfort one another with these words." (1 Thess 4:16-18)This pre-tribulation stance blog chronicles the signs Jesus told us would indicate the End Times and exhorts for repentance in these last days.By Elizabeth Prata; Christian.
