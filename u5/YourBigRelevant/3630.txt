UN wants new global currency to replace dollar



THE TELEGRAPH  The dollar should be replaced with a global currency, the United Nations has said, proposing the biggest overhaul of the world's monetary system since the Second World War.
 In a radical report, the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has said the system of currencies and capital rules which binds the world economy is not working properly, and was largely responsible for the financial and economic crises. 
 It added that the present system, under which the dollar acts as the world's reserve currency , should be subject to a wholesale reconsideration. 
 Although a number of countries, including China and Russia, have suggested replacing the dollar as the world's reserve currency, the UNCTAD report is the first time a major multinational institution has posited such a suggestion.

Pope Declares Mary as "The Ark of the Covenant " and  " The New Eve"



Catholic Culture.org  In his midday Angelus address, delivered at the apostolic palace, Pope Benedict noted that the feast of the Assumption has “roots in the faith of the early centuries of the Church … Our forefathers were defeated by the Evil One; in the fullness of time, Jesus, the new Adam, and Mary, the new Eve, defeated the enemy definitively, and this is the joy of this day!”   Editor's note: The pope's reference to the Virgin Mary is more akin to Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code or the Egyptian mythology og Isis, Osirus and Horus.  See why the Mary of the Bible is not the same as the Mary of Rome.

The New World Order Out of Financial Chaos



THE BUSINESS INSIDER:  "...Anyway, that’s the story: there’s too much debt, it all needs to be rolled up into a new currency so that the losses can get spread around. This new currency system will come about in a top down fashion – meaning supranational institutions like the IMF and World Bank issue the currency and re-define economic regions and trade agreements, forming what essentially amounts to a world government – until there is a bottom up revolution, powered by virtual currencies issued by non-state networks. Whatever kinds of monetary systems emerge out of this mess, gold will likely play a part in this process."  See more on the Rise of The Fourth Kingdom

THE GREAT GULF COAST HOLOCAUST



The Silent Voices of Science  As a result of spraying Corexit, many researchers have highlighted the dangers associated with exposure to the oil and the corexit. Dr. Wilma Subra, a chemist and microbiologist, speaking at “Truth Out for the Gulf Forum,” stated that blood tests taken from Gulf Coast residents who have become ill, reveals exposure to crude oil and the subsequent presence of the well known cancer causing agents of Benzene and Hexane at an average of 36 times the expected rate. Subra also found that Corexit produces the Leukemia causing agents of Ethylbenzene and Xylene at 5.7 and 5.68 times the normal expected levels in her test samples. Subra states that “this deadly toxicity is in the air, it’s in the dispersant and it is in the blood of the people."[11]
 Kim Anderson’s Oregon State University (OSU) researchers, from the OSU College of Agricultural Sciences, began a test-retest comparative analysis for the carcinogenic contaminant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and its biodegradable partner, OPAHs, which appears after the application of corexit and subsequent exposure to ultraviolet rays. Stunningly, the OSU researchers found a 40 fold increase in these carcinogenic compounds in the comparative test-retest period.[12] The OSU findings replicate the conclusions of Mace Barron [13] and the Mace Barron et al [14] regarding the toxicity of Corexit and its use in the Exxon Valdez oil spill. The Exxon Valdez oil spill and subsequent clean-up activities provides the only case study in the history of the United States involving significant exposure to the types of toxins discussed in this article as the result of an oil spill. Findings, related to the longevity of the Exxon Valdez clean-up workers, are very disturbing as their collective lifespan statistics revealed that the average life expectancy is a mere 51 years of age and nearly all of the Exxon Valdez clean-up workers are dead. [15], [16] These findings can leave little doubt that BP’s use of Corexit has seriously compromised the collective life span of Gulf Coast residents.

Self-avowed Muslim Marxist Says White House Tied to Muslim Brotherhood



THE NEW AMERICAN:  Tarek Fatah — a self-described devout Muslim Marxist — has issued a strong warning that there is a Muslim Brotherhood influence at the White House. Fatah, a Canadian, delivered this caution back in June at Canada’s annual “Premier Meeting of the Minds” function; however, his announcement was all but ignored.
 At the conference, Fatah expressed his own viewpoints on mainstream and radical Islam, including the Muslim Brotherhood. He asserted, “The religion of Islam is being used as a tool by a fascist force.”
 He then moved on to discuss what he views as the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood at the highest level of the federal government. “Instead of bringing victory over the fascist forces of the Muslim Brotherhood, we now recognize that their infiltration is right up to the American White House, but we can’t say that,” he said.
 According to Cal Thomas of the Washington Examiner, Fatah may be onto something, as it has been a longtime goal of the Muslim Brotherhood to infiltrate the leadership ranks of the United States. He wrote:
 In 1991, a memo written by Mohamed Akram for the Shura Council of the Muslim Brotherhood spelled out the objective of the organization. Akram said the Muslim Brotherhood “must understand that their work in America is a kind of grand Jihad in eliminating and destroying the Western civilization from within and ‘sabotaging’ its miserable house by their hands and the hands of the believers so that it is eliminated and God’s religion is made victorious over all other religions.”
 Some observers began to ponder a potential Brotherhood influence when James Clapper, President Obama's Director of National Intelligence, publicly referred to the Muslim Brotherhood as a “heterogeneous” and “largely secular group” just hours after the organization had  declared Sharia law as its ultimate goal.

'Electronic Tattoo' to Track Patients’ Vital Signs



'Electronic Tattoo' to Track Patients’ Vital Signs  An "electronic tattoo" could revolutionize medical sensing, computer gaming and even render the super slick James Bond movie gadgets antiquated.
 Researchers have developed a super-thin "skin-patch" that mounts onto the skin like a temporary tattoo and has an array of electronic components that allows researchers to track key vital signs from patients. The patches are already able to monitor the heart, various other muscles and brain activity.
 The micro-electronics technology, called an epidermal electronic system (EES), was developed by an international team of researchers from the United States, China and Singapore, and is described in the journal Science, reports the Associated Press.

Deep Impact of the Third Kind:  DNA in Meteors



Australian meteorite behind 'space DNA' discovery         A METEORITE which crashed in Australia more than four decades ago has led to a major new discovery about the nature of humankind.
 Writers and filmmakers have for decades hypothesised about little green men "out there" somewhere, but it turns out alien life may actually exist closer to home.
 Much, much closer.
 NASA overnight said researchers had discovered that some of the building blocks of DNA found in meteorites were actually created in space — lending weight to the idea that life on Earth began with material from the cosmos.  See also: The Coming Great Deception! ,

Churches Now Promote Islam



What would Jesus think? Churches now promote Islam 'Spiritual treason' seen as 'something hostile to Jesus Christ himself' - From World Net DailyDozens of Christian churches, from Park Hill Congregational in Denver to Hillview United Methodist in Boise, Idaho, and First United Lutheran in San Francisco to St. Elizabeth's Episcopal Church in Honolulu, are planning to send "a message both here at home and to the Arab and Muslim world about our respect for Islam" with a time to read the Quran during worship this Sunday.It's not just wrong, but dangerous, according to Christian trends analysts.Not so fast, says Apprising.org religious trends analyst Ken Silva."I would think they need to have their spiritual heads examined. It'sfoolish to think that we're going to read something that originates with demons and read that in a Christian church," Silva said.The action amounts to "spiritual treason," he asserted.

Evangelicalism's Altered Spiritual State



MEDITATION IN ALTERED STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS AS TRANSFORMATION FOR A GLOBAL FAMILYFor the household gods utter nonsense, and the diviners see lies; they tell false dreams and give empty consolation. Therefore the people wander like sheep; they are afflicted for lack of a shepherd. (Zechariah 10:2)...Why do Christians, who ostensibly have a personal relationship with God in Christ, suddenly have to turn to Buddhists, who may or may not even believe there is a God, in order to learn about Christian spirituality? This kind of lunacy in the Lord’s Name where Peter Scazzero, who is partnered with Willow Creek Association (WCA) and has also been promoted by PD Pope Rick Warren as well, to send his followers to basically Buddhist Bourgeault and to Thomas Keating, an apostate Roman Catholic mystic, should immediately arrest your attention.Read the rest at APPRISING MINISTRIES.Click here to learn how you can support the work of APPRISING MINISTRIES.

Rick Warren Receives John Piper's Seal of Approval



JOHN PIPER’S INTERVIEW WITH RICK WARREN AT SADDLEBACK REAPPEARS from Apprising Ministries:...Now, it seems, Piper’s become “appalled at the kinds of slanders” that have supposedly been leveled at Warren; and Piper is already on the record as having stated:"At root I think [Rick Warren] is theological and doctrinal and sound." (as cited Online source)In my aforementioned piece I noted via an update that not more than an hour or two after my piece went online at AM the page to the interview of Rick Warren by John Piper would vanish. I already had on file the pdf transcript done by Warren’s people and also put it at the bottom of that article because it had been removed from the Pastors.com website as well.So I will remind you here that previously in John Piper Interview With Rick Warren Vanishes I provided all of the documention that was originally there, e.g. the below...Read the rest at Apprising Ministries.See also: Piper's Interview With Warren: Now You See It, Now You Don't

World Bank: A New World Order Emerging



 FREE MALAYSIA TODAYThe World Bank noted that emerging markets now account for two- thirds of the world’s foreign exchange reserves–a reversal of the picture of the previous decade when industrialized countries owned the bulk of the reserves.China has the biggest share of the global reserves among emerging markets at US$3 trillion.“In short, a new world order with a more diffused distribution of economic power is emerging–thus the shift toward multi- polarity,” the World Bank report.The rising role of emerging markets would eventually diminish the primacy of the US dollar in international trade and finance. Eventually, countries would keep almost equal shares of the US dollar, the euro and the renminbi in their foreign exchange reserves, the bank added.“Over the next decade or so, China’s size and the rapid globalization of its corporations and banks will likely mean a more important role for the renminbi. The most likely global currency scenario in 2025 will be a multi-currency systm centered around the dollar, the euro, and the renminbi,” the report said.

Piper's Interview With Warren:  Now You See It, Now You Don't



JOHN PIPER INTERVIEWS RICK WARREN AT SADDLEBACK from Apprising Ministries:*UPDATE* Since this article went online at Apprising Ministries the page to the interview of Rick Warren by John Piper appears to have vanished.However, I was able to retrieve the video page—at least for now. AM already has the pdf transcript on file, but unfortunately right now it does seem to appear at the website.Unfortunately well-respected evangelical pastor Dr. John Piper exhibited a real error in judgment when he invited Dr. Rick Warren who, because of bullying tactics so often used in hostile Purpose Driven Church takeovers, I refer to as The Purpose Driven Pope[1] to be the keynote speaker at the Desiring God Conference 2010.For too brief a time it opened up a bit of a Warrengate across the blogosphere as more and more people found out; and as a precious few of the big “names” within evangelicalism weighed in. Apprising Ministries has been keeping you apprised as to it all as best I can. As a former Roman Catholic, and currently a Southern Baptist minister—as is Rick Warren—it’s no secret that I’m on record as saying that Warren is heretical in, at least, his double-minded stance concerning the Roman Catholic Church...Read the rest at Apprising Ministries.
