From Wikipedia: en.wikipedia.org The 1971 San Fernando earthquake (also known as Sylmar earthquake) struck the San Fernando Valley near Sylmar at 6:00:55 am PST on February 9, 1971, with a magnitude of 6.6. There are various names for this earthquake. Seismologists call it the San Fernando earthquake. USGS 'Sylmar Quake' or 'Sylmar earthquake' is the name initially given to the event by local media outlets, because the worst damage was to the Olive View Medical Center, located in Sylmar. Local veterans of 'the Sylmar Quake' commonly refer to this seismic event as the 'February Ninth' quake. Contains the famous line about the earth shaking "like an angry parent shakes his screaming child!"

This is clipped from the film, Earthquake, documenting the San Fernando Valley, California earthquake of 1971 with a focus on the rescue efforts and a hospital collapse. Federal disaster relief had just been increased and the Office of Emergency Preparedness formed, and the film shows how they addressed their first major disaster. California Governor Ronald Reagan and US Vice-President Spiro Agnew appear adding an interesting historical note to this clip. The entire film is available at the Internet Archives.

Old footage of some of the destruction resulting from the 1971 San Fernando earthquake. My dad rushed us out and filmed some of the freeway damage. The footage has been damaged in the 40 years since it has been shot. It is eerie how some of the damage follows the patterns of the building edges and other visual elements.
