Obama jobs speech: This time with feeling!





 Should emoticons be added to the Obama jobs speech telecast? The solutions President Obama offers for jobs creation when he gives his speech before a joint session of Congress will more than likely be more of the same that he has offered before. Programs requiring massive amounts of new spending and a commensurate rise in our national debt all linked to new government infrastructure required for implementation.   Obama proposals will most likely be non-starters! These programs will most likely be a non-starter for Republicans if for no other reason than the fact that the massive amount of spending already done by this President has resulted in zero new jobs and a still stagnant US economy. An economy in real danger of moving into an even deeper recession. In reality the Presidents proposals will be non-starters because of the massive amounts of spending and new borrowing they will require to be implemented. Spending coupled with a probable proposal to increase the taxes on the "millionaires, billionaires and corporate jet owners" who, according to Democrat talking points, need to share the burden of responsibility to get the country back on track. Friends of Obama excluded of course! The President will in a veiled way say that if these programs are not put into place, and no jobs creation results in the time leading up to the 2012 presidential election, why then it's the fault of the Republican Party for being obstructionist and for playing political games with the lives of Americans.  Coming from the consummate political games player, these statements would be extremely ironic and disingenuous. The President is going to be playing a high stakes political game with this speech, and the economy and the American public are going to be used as the pieces. This is a campaign speech, nothing more and nothing less, although it is being positioned as providing hope and solutions for Americans unemployed, underemployed or who have simply given up. President Obama, this time with feeling! Although I should not be giving advice to the man who is single-handedly (with a little help from his friends) trying to bring down the US economy, here it is. Get off of your teleprompter and speak from your heart about what you see and feel about the plight of so many Americans. Act less like an emotionless automaton and more like a feeling, caring leader. Understand that those people who still bother to watch and listen to your speeches are desperate for solutions and not for campaign slogans. If it is not possible for you to accomplish these things, have your staff add emoticons to the bottom of the T.V. screen so the people know what points you are trying to convey!

Will Hurricane Katia hit the east coast of the U.S.? (tracking map)





 The east coast was pounded a little over a week ago by Hurricane Irene and now may face Hurricane Katia! With power out for more than four days as a result of Hurricane Irene, we just replaced the food lost in our freezer and refrigerator. The damage to the roof from a tree limb falling on it in the middle of the night has not been fixed yet. Cities hit hard are still assessing the damage. Now the tracking map below shows that the east coast may face the prospect of another hurricane making landfall. Hurricane Katia from Weather.com    "The forecast calls for continued strengthening to a major hurricane (category three or higher) as Hurricane Katia moves off to the northwest. It is still too early to determine if any land areas, including the U.S. East Coast, will be directly affected by this system."    "It would be a good idea for people on the East Coast just to keep watching this storm." (US National Hurricane Center)   Hurricane Katia forecast         The Political Commentator: Please subscribe, Tweet and Google +1 below!

Is the US economy back in recession? (CNN poll)





 A more interesting question might be if the US economy ever came out of recession in the first place? Recession: A decline in GPP for two consecutive quarters.Recession: When your neighbor loses his job.Depression: When you lose your job! Economic statistics are a funny thing in that the only people they really matter to are the pundits who debate them. I watch and read the discussions over whether the US economy is in danger of double-dipping back into recession. The suits on television banter back and forth that while activity is tepid and stagnant and that unemployment will remain at historically high levels for the foreseeable future, they just don't see the US economy dropping into contraction territory! What all of the analysis of economic statistics mean to Americans! Beyond some textbook economic recession/economic growth definition, has the US economy really ever emerged from recession! Whether the US economy is growing at 1% a year or contracting 1% a year, the economic reality for the bulk of Americans working in corporate jobs or who run their own small business is that times are really no better now than they were two years ago. How do I know that? Through anecdotal analysis conducted at bars, social gatherings and in conducting my day to day business. These are the people who look at their bank accounts with many more withdrawals than deposits, whose company's are laying off or about to lay off more people and who dread getting the mail each day only to see bills coming in.  For them, the US economy is functionally in recession!  CNN poll on what Americans think about the economy! Fully 82% of those polled see the US economy in recession! Of that number 35% see us in a serious recession. Since Obama came into office and massively increased the nations debt under the auspices of jump starting the economy, the number of Americans with the opinion of serious recession has not dipped under 30%. President Obama's jobs speech Assuming that President Obama is watching the polls as a guide for his jobs address, over a 2/3 majority in this CNN poll said that jobs creation should take priority over any deficit reduction. Suffice it to say that the American public will be watching this campaign speech very closely!  The Political Commentator: Please subscribe, Tweet and Google +1 below!

Video rant from a real American and the 50 richest members of Congress!





 List of the 50 richest members of Congress! These are some of the same politicians in Washington who profess to know the pain of the Americans who live on Main Street. Americans struggling to make ends meet who may be living hand to mouth and paycheck to paycheck.  Americans who may have lost their jobs and who cannot find a new one.  Americans who want to possess the feeling that perhaps they can retire some day and provide for their children today. Somehow those claims of feeling the pain made by politicians ring as hollow and implausible when you look at their individual net worths. A rant by one of the real citizens of Main Street!

Important Quotes

"I cannot recall at any time when the gap between the kind of words which statesmen used and what was actually happening in many countries was so great as it is now. The habit of saying smooth things and uttering pious platitudes and sentiments to gain applause, without relation to the underlying facts, is more pronounced now than it has ever been in my experience.”-- Winston Churchill"That government is best which governs the least, because its people discipline themselves."-- Thomas Jefferson"History does not long entrust the care of freedom to the weak or timid."-- Dwight D Eisenhower“There are two ways to conquer and enslave a nation. One is by the sword. The other is by debt.”-- John Adams
