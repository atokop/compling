Jokes abound online after quake

Earthquake causes little damage, lots of Internet humor
      Video


By Emma Mustich








AP/Charles Dharapak
People crowd Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, Tuesday, as they evacuate buildings after a 5.9 magnitude earthquake hit the Washington area. 

This afternoon's earthquake had barely stopped before the online jokes started.
Since the geological incident -- which occurred in Virginia, but was felt up and down the East Coast -- Twitterers (and other merry Internet pranksters) have invoked everyone from God to Ryan Gosling in their efforts to mock sensationalist responses and calm frazzled nerves.
Some of our favorite online reactions -- in addition to this much-shared photograph of "DC Earthquake Devastation" -- are these:

@joeljohnson: New York earthquakes are better because of our thinner crust.


@joshtpm: BREAKING: Obama WH announces contingency planning for Locusts, Frogs, Potomac running red.


@YUCKYBOT: Text "You spilled your chai latte" to 90999 to donate $1 to the victims of the U.S. East Coast earthquake.


@pourmecoffee: Earthquake in DC. Do not panic. A Super Committee will be formed to at some point possibly decide what to do.


@DanAmira: SORRY LIBYAN REBELS, THE GROUND OVER HERE SHOOK FOR LIKE 15 SECONDS. GOOD LUCK W/ EVERYTHING, WE DON'T CARE ANYMORE.

The quake also abruptly interrupted a press conference about the DSK rape case held in New York City by local District Attorney Cyrus Vance; the clip [via The Daily Beast] is worth watching:
