							Roy Payne's Ye Olde Flower Shoppe in Mineral, Va., sustained considerable damage during the 5.8 earthquake on Tuesday.

MINERAL, Va. -- Residents of this small town in Central Virginia's farming county began repairing the damage to their homes and businesses Tuesday after an earthquake struck their close-knit community. The quake measured 5.8 on the Richter scale, a force not seen in this part of the country in more than a century.
"I felt the whole house coming in from underneath me, and everything flew off the shelves," said Dot Payne, a lifelong resident of Mineral. "It felt like it lasted forever, but it was probably only 40 seconds."
The quake was felt as far north as New York City, and caused a building to collapse in Washington, D.C., but there was little visible damage in Mineral, near its epicenter. 
Payne said the Mineral Fire Department inspected her modest, white clapboard house less than an hour after the quake, which happened around 2 p.m. ET. "They found some cracks, and our chimney has moved a little, but it's alright otherwise," she told The Huffington Post. Payne is confined to a wheelchair and said her husband, Roy Payne, has cleared a path for her in their house, but little else had been done in the way of cleaning up.
Elsewhere in town, crews could be seen drawing tarps over chimneys, and one small church between Mineral and the adjacent town of Louisa had a collapsed wall, but the majority of the damage appeared to be indoors.
Roy Payne's flower shop is adjacent to the couple's house, and he invited HuffPost inside to survey the damage. The grassy green floors were strewn with bouquets of faux flowers in assorted vases, and smashed painted china figurines littered the area around the cash register. "I've never felt anything like it," Roy Payne said of the quake. "I reached up to save a framed picture on the wall and I got knocked down. Then I stood up and got knocked down again."
When the quake passed, Payne's first thought was for his wife, who was especially vulnerable given her limited mobility. "I just raced over to the house to see about Dot." Despite the damage to both his home and his business, Roy Payne said he planned to re-open Ye Olde Flower Shoppe the next day. "I've got a delivery coming in tomorrow, and I feel blessed that no one was harmed."
 The Bennett sisters, Cathy and Cheryl, also said they feel lucky, despite the fact that two chimneys were destroyed on the home they share with their aging father. "Daddy had just stepped out for a walk, holding onto his wheelchair when the chinmeys crashed," Cheryl said, "so we're real blessed he wasn't hurt." The sisters are both in their mid-fifties -- Cheryl Bennett lives on disability payments and Kathy Bennett is a substitute teacher.
Kathy said a fireman had visited the house to ensure no one was hurt, but she had yet to receive an assessment of the structural damage to her home. "There are huge chunks of plaster that fell out of the walls," she explained, "but what really worries me is the ceiling. There are lots of pieces falling out there, too." Both the Bennetts and the Paynes said electrical power had been restored shortly after the quake.
One cause for concern in Mineral and beyond is the nearby North Anna nuclear power facility, which has long been a controversial presence in the rolling farmland of central Virginia. The plant's two reactors were shut down Tuesday afternoon, but neither the Bennett sisters nor the Paynes said they are worried about the potential for hazardous damage to the facility.
"Our daddy worked for Westinghouse all his life, and they build those things to withstand a lot more than this," Cheryl Bennett said.
Dot Payne brushed off a question about the town's proximity to North Anna. "All the news reports care about the plant," she said, "but all we care about are the people right here in our town."

				Does anybody know the extent of the earthquake on Chincoteag­ue? i have been unable to figure out how far apart the two towns are since I can only use directions sites (like Google Maps) and you have to take a long complicate­d route between Mineral and Chincoteag­ue. I live in Pennsylvan­ia but have a house on Chincoteag­ue that I won't be able to visit for a few weeks. I'm a little worried because it's an older house so if anybody who lives there or knows somebody there knew what the damages are like, that would be great.

Unfortunat­ely MORE BAD NEWS. As Hurricane Irene begins to work its way up the Eastern Seaboard, the Rains, let alone the Winds are going to cause more damage.

Get out your Wal Mart Disposable­/Cell Phone /Digital Cameras and take as many pictures of the:

				Thankfully no serious injuries but we escaped a ticking time bomb.  Hope our government takes the hint and starts really focusing on upgrading our infrastruc­ture especially our bridges and nuclear plants.  We escaped a major tragedy as the plants on the east coast are only designed to handle up to 6.0.  We had a 5.8 so very scary.  One of the generators designed to cool and prevent a meltdown failed in the plant near the epicenter, a scary scenario.  We need to stop spending of billions and billions in foreign countries and on wars and work on improving our nation infrastruc­ture before it is too late.  Homeland security is what it is all about and that means a strong, vital nation not one with its infrastruc­ture crumbling.  Let's push our elected officials to work together on these critical issues at home.  Hope their extended vacations reinvigora­te and redirects their minds in a positive direction.  Enough bickering and blaming.

				I never felt the Oklahoma tremor, but we have plates I guess.  I've only felt one jolt since I've been here in OK.  It's kind of like someone sets your house down hard.  Spent many years in Southern California­, so am accustomed to earth moving, was even dumped out of my bed one New Year's Eve.  Hope everyone can come to agreement with their insurance companies.­.read the fine print, because many require earthquake insurance for reimbursem­ent.  They pay extra for it in California­.

				Heard from Aunt in Florida, who got a call through to Aunt and Uncle in Mineral VA (yes, people do live there, and it's a charming little burg in the mountains)­.  They've lost a lot of collectibl­es, and will be making repairs, but they are safe.  My grandparen­t's farm was just outside Louisa VA, and it is still not very populated.  Guess it's too close to the nuclear plant.

				I'm a grumpy old SOB and LIKE that name for a rural flower shop.
And I'm REALLY glad to hear that the damage was limited, with no casualties­. It could have as easily turned real ugly.
What is ironic is, I was reading a CNN story on a 5.8 earthquake in Colorado when this one shook me around in SE Pennsylvan­ia.
At first, I thought something was wrong with me, in a bad medical way.
Then, I noticed the monitor was shaking and looked at my water bottle to see the water being shaken in it and figured out we were having an earthquake­.
My wife was leaning against the wall, due to the shaking and nerve damage in her spine. SHE didn't know what was going on until I told her, "What the HELL?! We're having an earthquake­!"
No damage here, I think the clay under the foundation was absorbing a lot of the movement. Our daughter's house, two miles away, had some cracks and was making LOTS of loud cracking noises.

				Hope your wife is okay.  I can sympathize with her.  I was sitting in a cabin on the side of Mt. Rainier when there was a big earthquake­. (7.2 or thereabout­s.) The day before I'd had 3 teeth extracted and was sitting on the couch zonked out of my mind on pain pills when the windows started to shake.  Then the whole cabin started to shake.  I was sitting there thinking "Cool, we're having a earthquake­, I wonder if the volcano is going to erupt?" 

Meanwhile the Park Rangers were running around beating on doors and telling everyone  "We're evacuating­!  Head up to the Ridge!"  They were afraid the earthquake would shatter the glacier at the head of the river and send a lahar (glacial mudslide/f­lood) down the hill.  Nothing happened and we all went back home in awhile, but it was fun while it lasted.  In case of natural disaster I highly recommend being zonked out of your mind, it makes the whole thing much more amusing.

But I still think "Ye Olde Flower Shoppe" is a loathsome name.  How about "Ye Olde Muffler Shoppe",  "Ye Olde Computer Shoppe", "Ye Olde Bookie Shoppe"?  Bleah.

I don't know how old you are be regardless you need to grow the heck up and stop being hateful!
