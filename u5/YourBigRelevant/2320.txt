Spare me the west coast tough-guy bravado.﻿ I live in Greece, the 3rd most earthquake prone country in the world. I went through a 5.9 in Athens in 1999 that killed about 140 people. A couple of years ago, there were earthquakes in the 6's elsewhere in the country that didn't kill anyone. You simply can't know what will happen. It depends on the distance and depth away from you.
The only sure thing is that only an idiot doesn't respect a 5.9.
