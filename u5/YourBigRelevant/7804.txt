    (CBS/AP)  Updated at 6:30 p.m. ET  TRIPOLI, Libya - Hundreds of Libyan rebels blasted through the green gates of Muammar Qaddafi's Bab al-Aziziya compound in Tripoli Tuesday after five hours of intense fighting around it. They beat and killed some of those who defended it, fired celebratory shots in the air and hauled off crates of weapons and trucks with guns mounted on the back.  The storming of the sprawling compound in the capital, long the nexus of Qaddafi's power, marked the effective collapse of his 42-year-old regime, even though pockets of resistance are likely to persist around the country for some time. It was only Sunday night that the rebels surprised everyone with their lightning fast advance into Tripoli, quickly capturing large parts of the city of 2 million.  Complete coverage: Anger in the Arab WorldVideo: Rebels to Qaddafi: "Go to hell"Inside Qaddafi's storied, now stormed, compoundPhotos: Inside Muammar Qaddafi's lair  "We're looking for Qaddafi now. We have to find him now," said Sohaib Nefati, a 29-year-old rebel sitting against a wall with a Kalashnikov rifle. Qaddafi's whereabouts were still unknown.  As rebels advance, where is Qaddafi?McCain: Qaddafi's WMDs must be securedEU to unfreeze Libya assets once UN approves  CBS News correspondent Barry Petersen, reporting from inside Qaddafi's compound, said rebel soldiers didn't find anyone after breaching the stronghold through its north gate.  "There was no one from Qaddafi's army; no one was there," a rebel soldier told Petersen.  "We're seeing soldiers pouring in, soldiers pouring out, some taking souvenirs, things like ammo," Petersen told CBS Radio News from the compound. "Still heavy fire coming from one of the areas over there. We're not sure whether it's small-arms fire, heavy fire.  (At left, listen to Petersen's latest report)Video: Listen to Petersen's earlier front-line report  "This is something that the people of Libya have never seen," Petersen continued. "This was Qaddafi's playground. Huge, empty fields with beautiful trees, what looks like a mansion or a house ... someone stealing a compact fax machine, taking what they can, stealing what they can, taking away from a man who ruled them for 40-some years."  Will Libya's rebels remain united?The unclear fate of Libya's 4 most-wanted men  One fighter climbed atop the iconic statue of a huge golden fist clenching a model of an American warplane and shot his machine gun in the air in celebration. The statue stands outside a building that was once Qaddafi's home, preserved with the pockmarks of an American bombing in 1986 as a symbol of his defiance.  
The battle comes to Tripoli 






  Qaddafi delivered many a fiery speech from the balcony of that house, railing against the West. It was there that he appeared on television at the beginning of the 6-month-old uprising, mocking his opponents.  Bab al-Aziziya has since been pummeled many times over by NATO bombings in the air campaign against the regime that began in March.  Abdel-Aziz Shafiya, a 19-year-old rebel dressed in camouflage with an RPG slung over one shoulder and a Kalashnikov over another, said the rebels believe Qaddafi is hiding underground inside the complex.  "Wasn't he the one who called us rats. Now he is the rat underground," he said. Asked how it felt to be standing inside Qaddafi's compound, the fighter who came from to Tripoli two days ago from rebel-held western city of Misrata replied:  "It's an explosion of joy inside. I lost friends and relatives and now I can walk into Qaddafi's house. Many of my friends have died and now all of that meant something."  Associated Press reporters inside the compound said parts of it appeared to still be under control of government forces who were firing toward the rebels, making for an atmosphere of joyful celebration mixed with tension. The air was thick with smoke from the battles and the sound of crackling gunfire was constant. Rebels chanted "Allahu Akbar" or "God is Great" and on loudspeakers they cried: "Hamdullah, hamdullah" or "Thank God."  As the fighters stormed in, they captured a guard at the gates and threw him to the ground, slamming rifle butts into his back. A hostile crowd gathered around, punching and kicking him until one rebel stepped in, stood over him and kept the crowd at bay. Inside the walls, a few bodies of Qaddafi fighters  one with a gaping head wound from a gunshot  were sprawled on the ground.  Fighters with long beards hugged each other and flashed the "V" for victory. Others carried injured rebels to ambulances.  There was a frenzy of looting inside, directed mainly at weapons. Thousands of rebels converged on the compound after it was breached, snatching ammunition and arms from depots inside. They found brand new rifles still in their paper wrappings. Scuffles broke out, pushing and shoving to get inside two white buildings where the rifles, machine guns and handguns are stored. They came out drenched in sweat from the struggle.  Some used a rifle bayonet to crack open a green box that contained guns and pushed each other to lay their hands on the booty.  Ali Sameer, a 45-year-old Tripoli resident, stood nearby with three brand new rifles resting on his legs.  "They are for my friends. I don't even know how to fight," he said.  Abdul-Salamah Alawah, 29, who arrived on a boat from Misrata last night, loaded a clip into his handgun.  "This one is especially for Qaddafi," he said.

NOW WE WILL SEE WHO STEPS UP TO THE MICROPHONE IN LIBYA. HOPEFULLY A NEW GOVERNMENT WILL BE REBORN FOR THE PEOPLE BY THE PEOPLE . CAUTION THIS TYPE GOVERNMENT CAN BE STOLEN AND CONTROLLED FROM SUPER RICH IN MANY GUISES.     Reply to this comment            by sepa2 August 23, 2011 5:05 PM EDT  Now this is is nearing end let us sharpen our skills on lecturing others on negotiated settlements, diplomacy, human rights and things like that     Reply to this comment            by imnotimportant August 23, 2011 4:59 PM EDT  Americans don't need to do everything. At times, they need to help just a little, and let others do the heavy lifting. Maybe the tea party needs to acknowledge Obama's and the US Air Force's success here in Libya.     Reply to this comment            by pdchapin August 23, 2011 2:52 PM EDT  NATO certainly makes things easier and probably saved their butts when the air strikes started, but it's well beyond that now. If NATO stopped today it would only delay the end. This attack was a well-coordinated, planned and executed. The rebels flat out out-generaled Qaddafi.     Reply to this comment            by pdchapin August 23, 2011 2:48 PM EDT  Except that Qaddafi admitted responsibility for Lockerbie. Part of his "but I wouldn't do that again" campaign.     Reply to this comment            by billkol August 23, 2011 2:44 PM EDT  "I have followed these young rebels from the beginning. I am so proud of them as it just shows what determination, with some help, will do. This can happen anywhere where young people take an interest and will give everything for a cause. God bless them."     Reply to this comment           by billkol August 23, 2011 4:34 PM EDT  "It is unfortunate that most of the young people in America have no interest in who governs them. Most of them could not name the vice president. These you people were willing to die for who governed them. Very sad.                         by temple1962 August 23, 2011 2:31 PM EDT  LMFAO - All news media sources get "punked" by a third world squalor dictator! First we have him and then we don't and it was so believable that the elusive American president wants to come out of hiding and start taking credit for an accomplishment that was not complete!     Reply to this comment           by thechooch1 August 23, 2011 2:36 PM EDT  What on earth are you talking about? "WE" never had anyone, maybe the Libyan's thought they had someone. So now our President is hiding? Why are you so anti-American? Did you want lots of body bags coming home? This has been a great accomplishment for the Libyan people you should be happy.                         by EmpireGeorge-_ August 23, 2011 2:05 PM EDT  Anybody in Virginia, did you just have an earthquake....we felt it all the way up to NY     Reply to this comment            by noloyalisti August 23, 2011 1:06 PM EDT  Great posts anti-global, keep up the good work.It is pretty clear that NATO and it's chief scoundrel member the United Corporate States of America (UCSA) wants to control Libyan oil. And spread freedom for Exxon, the banksters like Goldman and Chase and Wa-Mart.     Reply to this comment           by thechooch1 August 23, 2011 1:16 PM EDT  noloyalisti guess you missed Lockerbie?                      by noloyalisti August 23, 2011 1:25 PM EDT  And so we just now decided to take out Qaddafi? And all of a sudden you are going to trust what the US is doing overseas?
