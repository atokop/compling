23Aug20113:56pm, EDTSmall quake has big reachNicholas Kamm / AFP / Getty ImagesPeople stand in a square outside the courthouse after an earthquake was felt in New York Tuesday, causing buildings to be evacuated. The Pentagon, the U.S. Capitol and Union Station in the nation's capital were all evacuated after the 5.9-magnitude quake, which was shallow with its epicenter only 0.6 miles (one kilometer) underground.By John RoachA magnitude-5.8 earthquake in Virginia Tuesday afternoon was felt across the U.S. East Coast, shaking offices and nerves from Washington D.C. to New York City and as far south as Chapel Hill, North Carolina. There are even reports of shaking as far west as Columbus, Ohio, and out on Martha's Vineyard.That's a whole lot of shaking for what amounts to a medium-sized quake. The reason for its reach, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, is geology of the East Coast."The reason an earthquake in the high 5s is felt so far away is that it occurred in an area … where the bedrock is solid, it's not really fractured or broken up by faults the way it would be, say, in California," Peter Powers, a geophysicist with the survey, told me today.The seismic energy in areas with stable bedrock — "stable continental craton" in geophysics speak — can travel much farther than it can when broken up by young faults."Seismic energy attenuates very slowly on the East Coast," Powers said. "On the West Coast it attenuates much more rapidly because the bedrock is fractured and faulted and much more variable in its composition than on the East Coast."Seismologist Dr. Lucy Jones joins Brian Williams from the United States Geological Survey headquarters in Pasadena, Calif. The survey notes that earthquakes in the central and eastern U.S. are typically felt over a much broader region than those in the Western U.S., sometimes an area as much as ten time larger than similar magnitude earthquake on the West Coast."A magnitude 5.5 eastern U.S. earthquake usually can be felt as far as 300 miles from where it occurred, and sometimes causes damage as far away as 25 miles," the agency notes on its website.Early reports indicated the depth of the earthquake is also quite shallow — just 3.7 miles down in the Earth's crust. Powers said this would likely be revised deeper as time goes by and the data is further analyzed, but depth here isn't much of a factor in the shaking.The earthquake today on the East Coast, Powers said, was large enough to be felt over a large area no matter if its depth is ultimately determined to be 3 miles or 15 miles deep. "At that point, the depth really isn't much of a factor."Depth can be a factorIn other regions, however, depth of an earthquake can make a difference.Generally, the closer the epicenter of an earthquake is to the surface, the stronger the shaking on the surface and the more damage they cause, no matter what their size.Conversely, when earthquakes rupture deeper in the crust — they can rupture up to 500 miles deep — more energy is lost as it races to the surface.That's one reason why some relatively strong earthquakes, originating deep in the crust, cause little damage on the surface whereas some seemingly small earthquakes can cause massive damage.

The 7.0 magnitude earthquake in Haiti in January 2010 was 8.1 miles deep. The relatively shallow depth combined with subpar construction in Haiti caused massive damage there.A pair of minor earthquakes in Spain this May ruptured just over half a mile below the ground, causing several deaths and damaging buildings in a part of the world with a tame seismic history.The 9.0 magnitude earthquake hit Japan on March 11 began at a depth of 19.9 miles. Though devastating, it could have been worse had it been even shallower — and had Japan's infrastructure not been among some of the most earthquake ready in the world.John Roach is a contributing writer for msnbc.com.

An 5.8-magnitude earthquake in central Virginia was felt across much of the East Coast on Tuesday, causing light damage and forcing thousands of people to evacuate buildings in New York, Washington and other cities.

I'm in Rock Hill SC, and got quite a jolt! My couch started vibrating and swaying, the glass doors on the china cabinet started rattling, and a tall potted plant sitting on an end table started swaying back and forth. Really unnerving! The shaking didn't last too long, but the potted plant kept swaying for more than a minute...really strange!#2.1 - Tue Aug 23, 2011 9:51 PM EDTbongleblueThis is an example of what will continue to increase in frequency the closer we get to 2012.

Never mind.4 votes#3.7 - Tue Aug 23, 2011 6:53 PM EDTBluelakeHere's a suggestion for what to do when the end comes. Press the palms of your hands against your face, run counter-clockwise in a tight circle repeating over and over "oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God...Don't stop, keep doing it until you pass out. That way your neighbors will die laughing and you wont know what hit you.4 votes#3.8 - Tue Aug 23, 2011 7:22 PM EDTFrank GloverOccasionally on this site, we note the fact that Mars might have once been more active, but is not geologically almost dead. The Moon, even more so.
Guess what? You live on a planet that is not geologically or seismically dead.
This stuff occasionally happens, with no regard to what's on the surface. Always has, always will (until natural heat sources ultimately run down, unless Earth is destroyed when the Sun becomes a red giant star, first).
Get over it. (and don't live on the Pacific Rim, where this is more common...that's about the only way to reduce your risk, short of leaving Earth)2 votes#3.9 - Tue Aug 23, 2011 7:34 PM EDTARRELLYou DO understand that the 2012 movie was fiction and NOT a documentary, right?

Others in my office, however, were in pure panic mode as the building shook, the window panes bowed in and out and staplers, pens and pencils rolled off of desks.  It's just not something that one would expect to happen in these parts, but the quake itself was relatively minor and certainly harmless.  Thank God!2 votes#14 - Tue Aug 23, 2011 4:54 PM EDTJoy Franklin I live outside of Chelsea Michigan, a suburb of Ann Arbor.  At about 1:54 this afternoon I felt my computer chair moving and after a quick check realized there was NO way I was doing it.  Then I noticed that the fluid in my Diet Pepsi bottle was moving slightly. I yelled for my family and announced we were having an earthquake.  And I said what we were feeling was in the area of a 3.0 or 2.8 from past experience in Southern California.  They made fun of me a bit.......now I can gloat! 
I am very glad there were no ijuries to speak of nor severe damage.  Earthquakes are terribly frightening because there is NO control.  By the time one feels it the event is essentially over and all we on the surface can do is Hang On!#15 - Tue Aug 23, 2011 4:56 PM EDT
