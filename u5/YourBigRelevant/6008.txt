Electric Car Batteries are Greener than Expected



 


 Joshua S Hill in Energy & Fuel
371 days ago

The lithium ion (Li-ion) batteries that will be powering the electric cars of tomorrow are much greener than originally expected, according to new research conducted. Much has been made of whether electric cars will actually be the saviour of our future, or whether they are just redistributing the environmental damage to other aspects, like the… Read More…

How Journalists and Environmentalists are Co-opted As Corporate Spies

This isn’t breaking news, but Change.org has a great piece (via the Atlantic) on the story of a young, idealistic journalist who was offered the opportunity to be paid a mint ($20k) to take a dream trip through indigenous parts of Ecuador, and turned it down when she realized she was essentially being recruited as… Read More…

Ice Age Melting Caused by CO2 Release



 


 Joshua S Hill in Science
375 days ago

A recent study has shown that a large release of CO2 could in fact speed up the melting following an ice age. Authored by Tom Guilderson from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Center for Accelerator Mass Spectrometry, the study used radiocarbon dating to trace the pathway of carbon dioxide released from the deep ocean into… Read More…

Scottish Scientists Make Biofuel from Whiskey



 


 Tom Schueneman in Energy & Fuel

Giving “belly up to the bar” a whole new meaning… Bad puns aside, Scottish scientists recently announced a method for converting whiskey-making byproducts into biofuel (no bottled whiskey is harmed in the making of this fuel). Using samples from the Glenkinchie Distillery, researchers at the Biofuel Research Centre at Edinburgh Napier University have developed a process… Read More…

 Joshua S Hill in Science

Continuous research and development could soon see wind and solar dominate energy production, according to Nobel laureate Walter Kohn, Ph.D. Speaking at a symposium at the American Chemical Society’s 240’th National Meeting, Kohn said that he believed that with continuous research and development of alternative energies we could see an era in human history where… Read More…

Forecasts indicate that this year’s sea ice minimum, set to peak in September, will not be as low in 2007 which itself was the year that saw the Arctic sea ice at its smallest on record. But scientists are still concerned, and as a result are measuring the ice thickness north and east of Greenland…. Read More…

Huge Turtle Species Survived 50 Million Years, until Humans Came Along



 


 Zachary Shahan in Animals
377 days ago

A giant turtle species that scientists thought had gone extinct 50,000 years ago actually survived until recently on a small Pacific island. Apparently, though, it didn’t take long for humans to finish the species off. The turtle species belonged to a family of turtles that evolved 50 million years ago, the scientists say. Scientists weren’t… Read More…

‘Devastating Climate Shock’ Needed to Spur Climate Change Policy



 


 Michael Ricciardi in Disasters & Extreme Weather
378 days ago

In his alarm-ringing NY Times op-ed on Climate Change, professor Homer-Dixon* draws a comparison with the 2008 financial “meltdown” which finally led to new financial regulations, even though warnings of a housing bubble (and an emerging recession) were being made prior to the crisis.  He advocates societies designing a contingency plan (‘Plan Z’ ) to deal with the immediate after-effects of one or more climate change disasters.
