Environmental Wacko Story of the Week:  Did Fracking Cause the Virginia Earthquake?


Posted on August 24, 2011 by Conservative Byte 







Earthquakes in the nation’s capitol are as rare as hen’s teeth. The epicenter of Tuesday’s quake was in Mineral, Virginia, which is located on three very quiet fault lines. The occurrence of yet another freak earthquake in an unusual location is leading many anti-fracking activists (including me – they have just started fracking in Stratford, which is 40 minutes from New Plymouth) to wonder whether “fracking” in nearby West Virginia may be responsible.
Fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, is the process of initiating and subsequently propagating a fracture in a rock layer, employing the pressure of a fluid as the source of energy. The fracturing is done from a wellbore drilled into reservoir rock formations, in order to increase the extraction rates and ultimate recovery of oil and natural gas and coal seam gas.

I have read about this and it sounds possible to me, not only that, but the companies stopped doing it and earthquakes stopped, so the companies are not exactly in disagreement, it’s just not 100% for sure, and no one claims it is. It’s something to look into, not politicize.

I guess we’ll next have a moratorium on fracking like we do on deep water drilling.  Next we’ll all have to hug trees for warmth and ride bicycles to work.  Some jackarses won’t be happy until our country is on 3rd-world status.

Epa has been fracking the oboner for two and a half years, his ears are about to pop, and now they think it could happen to the earth, well hell easy one to figure out oboner has been fracking the whole earth for two and a half years, something has got to give, and it wont be us.

You know what ?  This is just stupid!  We have had earthquakes for millions of years.  Just like snow,ice and floods and droughts   and every kind of extreme.  To me in my simple little mind if we don`t get the oil and gases that keep forming out of the earth….then it will continue to build until we EXPLODE!!!!!!

The Wacks think fracking a well returns the same results as giving an enema to a Liberal environmentalist.  There is just no end to the explosive results.

Fracking is done a few thousand feet down and earthquakes happen six to 30 miles down.  No cigar.

Depth of the Virginia quake was 3.7 miles about 19,500 feet.
I see no reason that adding pressure at 2,00o feet wouldn’t affect formations much deeper as long as there was a solid connection between the two. Like most things in nature, it is undobtably very complicated.
Your simplistic novice opinion may be right, but it may also be 100% wrong.

Are you kidden me? pressure from fracking? that is like takeing one grain of sand and droping it in a olympic swimming pool and maake it run over, hell when they tested atomic bombs deed into the earth, they never made earth quakes, and how many did they test? even hyrodgen bombs, nil no quakes, Epa is like a elephant standing under a cocoanut tree with a piss ant running up her leg with rape on it’s mind, and when the ant sticks it in, a cocoanut falls out of the tree and hits the elephant in the head, oofgh the elephans says, oh sorry didnt mean to hurt you the ant says.

Texas probably has a more sandy soil than Virginia, which is rocky. Sounds possible to me. It was probably a conspiracy.

Texas has the Balcones fault.  Runs from Larado to San Antonio to Texarkanna.  Lots of quarries.  Caves.  Limestone.  Marble.  Granite.  and territory.  Texas is larger, if you were unaware, so chances should be greater.  Education is a wonderful thing.  Perhaps you should try it.

The Libs have a motto, “if it’s good for America it must be destroyed”. If you clowns don’t want oil used, come up with your magic substitute first. We’ve been fracturing for decades and there is virtually no correlation to quakes.  I realize commies only need to ‘Feeeeel” like there might be so destroy a whole industry, figure out a cheap way to generate hydrogen airheads. The reason lefties are always bureaucrats or teachers is because they can’t do anything and for those few who work, they think their pollution doesn’t count. Well four thousand of the lame brains did buy electric cars so they pollute from a smoke stack instead of a tailpipe, I suppose that means something. Libs hate truth—hey guys, your car NEVER justifies itself on a cost basis.

USGS report says the Mineral, VA quake was one kilometer deep.  The military was pressure feeding waste toxic material into rock in Colorado several years ago.  They often  had tremors during that time, and the tremors stopped when the project was completed.   Liquid under pressure can act as a lubricant to fractured rock, but was there such operations going on in Virginia?  The fracking would have had to be nearby and pretty shallow IMHO.

Sorry, but the quake was 6 km in depth, 3.7 miles, or about 20,000 feet below surface.

Today, Aug 24, there were 2 other quakes;
One at a depth of 3 miles, 3.4 intensity and another at a depth of 5 miles, 4.2 intensity.
That ain’t ‘shallow’.

I lived in CO at that time. Denver sits on a big fault, The Army at the Rocky Moutian Arsenal and shell chemical drilled a deep hole to rid of poisenus chemicals, and remnants ofmustard gas, they drained a whole lake into that hole, yes it made the ground settle around the fault. they stoped the tremmors stoped, but still have natural tremmors. I know this because I worked out there. That is all I’m gonna say. lol

Another WACKO Environmental theory with NO basis in fact in an effort destroy our country’s economy by eliminating out fuel supply.
Obama’s EPA has ordered 30%  of the coal fired electric powerhouse closed. Get you candles out and battery powered radios. 60,000 will be unemployed, look forward too rolling blackouts if you are lucky enough to get power at all.
These WACKOs won’t be happy until we are all rubbing 2 sticks together in caves, without air conditioning

None of you guys see the big-picture when it comes to our Dear Leader and his vision for America. His dream is to make America in China’s light. You see, although China is building coal power plants to produce electricity as fast as their slave labor can America can’t because we are the cause of ALL global pollution (and WARMING). If you people were one-tenth as smart as Obama and is crew of deep thinkers you would instantly see that he loves us and wants to give us a perfect society modeled after China’s. Think about it, we reduce pollution by eliminating jobs, thus people have no need to drive to work (or anywhere since they cannot afford gas). Next, Dear Leader builds “factories” and “worker apartments” next to the factories where “workers” can WALK to their government provided jobs. Naturally, schools will be provided near the apartments and factories where the workers one child will attend learning about all of the good done by Dear Leader. Let’s not forget that meals will be provided by Dear Leader to both workers and students… it will be great for everyone and make us closer to that utopia called China. You need not worry about earthquakes, inflation, unemployment or healthcare because Obama and Company will be there for you from cradle to grave (the grave part may come sooner than expected under this program). But remember, only the government knows what is best for you, so sit back tune out and relax and everything will be alright.

There is no way that drilling (fracking) some 40- 60 miles west of the epicenter can cause a 5.8 earthquake that is close to 4 miles deep. I know going green is the ultimate goal for libs., but it sounds like some body found some green up in the hills of W.V. I’m in central N.C.,  felt and heard the tremor. Would ask you to share that green you found up in the hills, but can’t on count of P-testing. What about the Colorado quake? Have you thought about the satanist running D.C. right now, might be releasing more of their demons from the depths of HELL. It sure is real close to their backyard.

This idea reeks of arrogance.  Global Warming caused by man reeks of arrogance.  Man is a pretty puny entity when it comes to nature.  Yes, man can kill a species (like we almost did to the American Bison), but causing earthquakes?  I am a retired U. S. Army Nuclear Weapons expert.  We tested nuclear warheads by detonating them underground.  The earth shook a bit when the weapon actually detonated, and some subsidence craters appeared, but no earthquakes.  I think someone is out of his ‘fracking’ mind.  There is a reason the word “coincidence” is a word…  By the way, a subsidence crater is caused by the sudden elimination of rock and soil.  The fireball literally vaporizes a bunch of rock and soil in the center of the fireball of the detonation, and the dirt on top of the ground slumps into the void.  An earthquake, it ain’t.  Fracking is much LESS intrusive to the earth.  It is hydraulic shock used to release gas from gas-bearing rock.  We also caused gas to be released from rock with nuclear warheads.  In fact, that works BETTER than fracking, but environmentalist weenies think anything nuclear is bad, even nuclear families.  One wish for Democrat environment twits…”May an armadillo nurse it’s young in your shorts”.

Anyone who believes that frac jobs cause earthquakes probably would also believe that the 100 degree plus heat wave in Oklahoma and Texas this summer could have been avoided if everyone would have turned on their air conditioners and opened the doors.  Beyond ridiculous!

Well, I can see the idiots are out!!  Does anyone recall a huge earthquake off the Japan coast followed by a large sunami?  I believe NOAA even said the earth’s tilt was even effected. Well, guess what, the earths plates are still adjusting globally to that.  Even the current LaNina was drastically effected by the devastation off the coast of Japan to the earth’s platelets.  Part of the reason this summer has been drastically hot in areas.  LaNina effects the weather stearing currents globally.  Fracing my big toe!!!!!!!!!!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!  Brilliant people, just brilliant…………Keep thinking deeply now!!!

As theory, the ratio is all wrong. To test that out, go hammer a straight pin into a bowling ball and see it begins to rumble, quake and crack all apart. (Where did these absolute morons go to school??)

In reality, if the fracking is causing the earthquakes, it is merely releasing the pressures in the rock, not adding to the pressures.  In other terms, it is giving us a lot of little quakes instead of one big quake.  Once the fracking has released all the pressure, the quakes have to stop.

How convenient!  Even EARTHQUAKES bow to the Liberals!  If THAT asinine suggestion was TRUE, how do you explain that “fracking” has been used for decades!  Why haven’t we seen MORE earthquakes?  The EPA is one Government controlled and approved of by O.B.  that should be forced to go on a “diet”!  Is there “weight watcher” programs for a OVER-WEIGHT Government?  We should enlist the help of one of O”bamas committees that are idle!  OH WAIT!

Has anybody else heard the story that’s going around about the earthquakes in Colorado and Virginia being set off by a nuclear device that was exploded underground in both those areas?  I’m not saying it’s true.  I’m just asking if anyone else has heard or read this story.

The area where the Virginia earthquake occurred is one of igneous and metamorphic rocks.   There is no shale there, or indeed any kind of fossil fuel.   No one would have been drilling into it or fracturing it.
