Yet Another US Earthquake - Colorado






A mere footnote to an article on the Virginia 5.8 quake reads as follows -

On Monday night, a quake struck in Colorado, far from any cities. It registered as a 5.3 and was the largest to hit the state in over a century, but barely merited a headline. Or, indeed, a tweet.

Where's Dutch Sinse?  Two earthquakes in a couple of days is consistent with his reports of rising earthquake threat across the country....and a media silence on one of them is consistent with the idea that there is a determination to keep the earthquake threat secret from people so far as is possible.

I'm sure Tap readers will let me know if they hear of any more Dutchsinse interviews landing on the net.  We'll be watching out for his next report.

The next quake might be coming from next door to Colorado, at Jackson Hole, on Friday night in the State of Wyoming, where Bernanke will be making his keynote speech for the Fed.  Will he be announcing QE3 or not?  If he doesn't, markets will no doubt take the cue and fall precipitously.

Maybe Yellowstone will erupt at the same moment.  There seems to be a plan to cause environmental and financial panicon the grand scale, judging by what we can see, on all fronts.  This time the elites, who make fortunes out of financial crashes, might actually succeed in getting one going.

The Colorado quake came two days too soon.  HAARP operators need to calibrate their equipment.


The fear factor is rising across the USA as these bizarre geological events unfold.  Pictured Downtown Washington DC after the very rare earthquake two days ago.

Tapestry's Story

THIS BLOG IS BANNED TO ANYONE UNDER 18  - By Google complying with government request.  No reasons given.NB Comments are often blocked on The Tap by hands unseen.  Please use email (in my profile) to reach me.The story of this blog is changing.  The number of people sending in links and comments is growing, and it is becoming a forum. Traffic was 10,000 page downloads a month in June 2010.  Today it is nearing 40,000 with great stuff being sent in by readers/contributors most days.  I am learning more from these than anything else in my life...school, university, newspapers, books...except the books you can't find in shops!I'm a UK Conservative who flips over to UKIP from time to time, and back again. When, one day the two parties amalgamate, I will be whole once more.  British democracy needs rebuilding outside the EU, freed from enslavement inside the cartels that control the world.  I write for a global audience on The Tap, with more than 50% of readers coming from outside the UK.The primary threat to mankind's future is not from the EU but the UN, which has a programme to achieve global control.    The EU is not the OWG but a device on the path towards One World Government.  The Euro may well collapse and with it, the EU.  Finland looks like being the first country to quit the EU.Behind the EU, however, sits the United Nations, being readied to take control.   It is, in any case, the United Nations, in cooperation with global cartels, controlled by a tiny group of powerful families, that sets the terms of how the world is run, not the EU.  They channel their power through various world bodies.  Decisions of the UN Security Council are binding on the member countries.  Britain is set to lose her seat to the EU. In Britain, the UN is setting up its own unofficial government hidden inside the ranks of our civil service, badged as Common Purpose.  That ''purpose'' is our enslavement.  The same thing is happening across the globe.The endgame of the current trend in world politics is a worldwide totalitarian state, planned a long time ago (see links below), now becoming visible.  Democracies are illusory.  Politicians are bought, and sell out the people who elect them.  Power resides in very few hands, and these hands are not benign.All that holds the totalitarians back is fear of the military.  Their plans include the erosion of national military forces, and their replacement with multi-national forces that owe no allegiance to any country.  Once that aim is achieved, whether it's done through cuts in numbers, slicing up each nation's military with those from other countries, or further use of vaccines, and exposure to toxic chemicals and metals designed to poison the bodies of traditionally-minded military forces, loyal to their own nations,  there will be nothing left to protect the rights of ordinary people from the total power of the structures that have taken control.  Wars are being started and prolonged in order to bring about these ends.The new focus of all power is the United Nations where evil resides.A primary plank of the OWG's programme is its determination to cut the world's population. Watch out for that favourite phrase of environmental fanatics like Prince Charles - 'sustainable development', which is becoming nothing less than the modern version of 'lebensraum'.  If you doubt what I say, read around the UN's programme for the 21st Century, known as Agenda 21.The UN is not a Christian institution.  It is a believer in 'Gaia', where humans are ascribed the same status as other animals and plants.  The Population Control agenda means controlling populations as well as their numbers.  This objective is being achieved through clandestine methods.Watch out for fluoride and toxic metals in water, dioxin in the food supply,  mercury and 'untested' viruses in vaccines and GM foodstuffs, directly targeting and incapacitating the human reproductive system. By such interventions, the numbers of people on the planet are being reduced. By that I mean, you and your kids are under attack, every minute of every day, physically and psychologically, by a media that promotes cultural childlessness, and that turns a blind eye to those who intend our demise, doctors that do what they are told, and corporations that make money out of the secret delivery of sterility and death.  You need to be aware and raise your defences.  Read 'Seeds Of Destruction' listed under Books You Should Read.The OWG doesn't want people to be educated, to become wealthy, lead healthy lives, have kids and organise society for the common good.  They want an elite living in luxury exploiting a slave race of lower beings who they can do with as they wish.  They also appear to be greatly interested in Satanism and paedophilia.Listen to www.radioliberty.com, and see if you disagree with this assessment.  Start with these videos -The Brotherhood Of Darkness (also a book)None Dare Call It GenocideThe facts are devastating.  The interpretation of the facts presented is up to you, but the facts given by Dr Stan Monteith in these two hour long talks,  are required by anybody who wants to form an understanding of the modern world, as it is taking shape today.Go to this URL here on The Tap, and take your search from there.  I give it in full as each time I embed the link, something decouples it.http://the-tap.blogspot.com/2011/01/dr-monteith-is-best-exponent-of-new.htmlRead 'The Population Control Agenda' By Dr Stan Monteith.Understanding the complete amorality of the One World Empire, and its commitment to its own survival over all else, explains why so many things are going wrong, and why so many people are suffering all over the world.   The world's secret leadership has got locked into a mentality of permanent war and power games.   If nothing else, read A Brief History Of The New World Order. Recent events show an acceleration of the programme to control the world.  North Africa, The Middle East and the HAARP attacks on Japan and China.  According to the late Christopher Storey, and Benjamin Fulford, financial journalist in Japan, the OWG is running out of funds, and are desperate to achieve global control while they still hold all the cards.  The dangers of a world war starting are great.What hope?They have built a structure based on secrecy, theft, murder and lies.  The problem with that is that once thieves get into control of everything, it can bring only one result - complete wastage.  If the world is headed for cataclysmic events, whether that be warfare, or financial collapse, change must be the result as people awaken to what has been happening while they were asleep. Next time the world's leaders design a model for the future, can we get rid of secret behind-the-scenes control as employed for the last hundred and more years?   The internet is working fast to reveal what was once possible to keep secret.  Maybe there's still hope if people awaken, start reading and reacting.influences and sources -radioliberty.comGlobal ResearchBrasscheck TVRealEcon TVjimcorr.comjohnredwoodsdiary.comwww.drjudywood.com/articles/JJOpen EuropeRobert Prechter of EWI (Be careful not to believe every word, but there is an element of truth)many Tap readers such as Derek, 'Me', Stuart and othersAnyone not used to the idea of a ''One World Government'', or 'The New World Order', as is often mentioned by politicians, will find it all a lot to take in.  Take your time.  Measure the events happening in the world, and see if they are consistent with the things being written and said in the media.  The first clue is when you realise that the stories you're hearing don't make sense.  After that your enquiries will discover what others before you have discovered.  I only act as a conduit between readers and researchers that have explained things to me, hopefully saving others time.The best book for explaining the fundamental corruption of the world's political and financial systems is still undoubtedly -WORLD WITHOUT CANCER by G.Edward Griffin.  It is partly a health book, and that part is well worth knowing about.  It describes the total penetration of all of government's agencies by powerful secretive international vested interests, which control the media, and effectively rule our lives.  People should not open their mouths and express any opinion until they've read this book.  The cancer topic is interesting in itself, and the personal health issues involved in living within a political structure which cares little if your kind dies out.  To avoid cancer, or alleviate it, think of buying these. If your freedom and right to the pursuit of happiness is going to be taken away, you might at least do all you can to hold on to your life.  Filter your drinking water down to one micron, and extract industrial fluoride wastes.  For that, call this outfit. (UK location) Keep away from National Health doctors who will try to inject you with vaccines covertly designed to cripple and kill, and prescribe anti-depressants and other substances dangerous to your health and wellbeing.  The doctors have no idea that they are being used to cull the population.  But if you read enough books that have the information, or listen to those who have researched the subjects properly, the picture of a totalitarian power that threatens your life as well as your freedom is clear enough.  Follow the links I've provided.Some of the people who pass through the virtual space of The Tap, ask me what I see my role as.  Basically I don't like to sit in silence in the face of a deteriorating political, financial and health environment, and prefer to write about things.  One of the functions I had in a past life was Chairman of a Parish Council.  I always liked to get people to talk, and would give visitors the floor.  By letting people explain themselves, you could quickly see what they were about, and what their game was.  It's not my role to position people.  I prefer to let people explain themselves, and to let their words define who they are.  Get people round the table and let them talk, is the idea.  The Blog is becoming just such a forum with many contributing stories in the comments and by email. I would question those in power of the planet if it really suits their purposes for countries and nations to become degraded to the point of disintegration.  The shift from the British Empire to the US Empire to the supranational Empire we are now seeing running the world still requires nations to be ''supra'' to.The OWG stands on the shoulders of the nations it subjugates.  By sucking the vitality and strength out of national existence, the OWG will finally bring about its own downfall.  The balance is all wrong, and that is caused by the secrecy, and ignorance of the world's people as to who is really in control and what they are doing.   The internet has a job to do in bringing the situation out into the open, from where much improvement could be achieved.  The threads of democracy need reconnecting.  Here at The Tap is a place, amongst many others, where that can happen.  If the threads don't get reconnected, we will in time all become victims of the most brutal totalitarian regime the world has ever seen - unless your name is Blair, Brown, Cameron, Hague, Clegg and their ilk, who have earned their position as treacherous insiders.Don't be confused by false topics designed to muddle your political thoughts, such as UFOs, reptiles, Jewish conspiracies and so on.  The One World Government programme is a programme of human beings residing on this earth, at this moment.  They are expert at hiding themselves from view as they have done very successfully for over a hundred years. Their objective is humanity's total enslavement.If you don't take all this in now, come back when you next get that feeling that something is wrong, and you don't see any other rational explanation for what you are witnessing.  Your children and their children will be most grateful if you do.See The War Against Humanity.The way to turn this around is to stop complying, to resist en masse.  Our own acquiescence is the way the system works.  The thing is to stop saying YES, and to start saying NO.  Say NO to vaccinations and medical interventions.  Say NO to wrong laws and wrong taxes.  Grow our own food and distribute it.  Control the education of our children.  Learn to select carefully who to trust and build a cooperative caring environment around ourselves.   Build the world ourselves from the bottom up to replace the world we are being given by the psychopathic elite that currently controls the world.  Take just two ours out of your life to find out.  Watch this video.  Here's how to supply all the power the world needs from water and sunlight.











Readers

Messages from readers -The Tap is a brilliantly informative blog, I tell people about it all the time and post links to articles on The Tap all over the place!Thank you and well done! ScottyGillian You are able to articulate in detail what I and many others are thinking but would never be able to fully express.If it wasn't for me finding your blog, I would still be groping in the dark and wondering why our government and the governments of other countries seemed to be governing with one hand tied behind their collective backs and definitely not in the interests of their people. So a big thank you to you for your blog site and the information you bring to us.I do have something going for me though and that is intuition and gut-instinct about people and situations.Sue The info on your blog and all the links that I follow as a result, leave me absolutely STUNNED! What a horrible world this is turning out to be. Their greed is insatiable. These people need to be exposed and hung out to dry. No wonder all of this has been put down to the realms of "nutter conspiracy theorists". It's almost impossible to conceive of such utter evilness unless you start to put the facts together. You then come to the conclusion, that it's all very real.Top 3 Countries (total page views 30,000+ monthly)United Kingdom 13,93613,936United States       4,4354,435Hungary               1,5311,531All time most read posts -Who Owns The Bank Of England?ANDPlanes Hitting Twin Towers Were Computer Graphicshttp://the-tap.blogspot.com/2010/11/planes-hitting-twin-towers-were.html
