Strong Earthquake Very Close to Virginia Nuclear Power Plant ... Main Power Out, Venting Steam


 Earthquake in Virginia: One of the Largest Ever On the East Coast One of the largest East Coast earthquakes in recorded history struck today.Very Close to Nuclear Power Plant The epicenter was very close to the Lake Anna nuclear power plant:   Click for larger  In fact, many U.S. nuclear power plants are built near earthquake faults.The Lake Anna reactor was ranked the 7th most at risk from earthquakes of any reactor by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.Indeed, today's quake was 5.9, and nuclear expert Bob Alvarez says that the Lake Anna plant was only built to withstand a 5.9 to 6.1 quake.And earthquake sensors were previously removed around the reactor due to budget cuts.
 As I've previously pointed out, Japan's nuclear meltdown, the economic meltdown, and the Gulf oil meltdown all happened for the same reason: cutting safety measures to make an extra buck.  Initial reports sounded scary:
 Virginia nuke plant “venting steam” — Spokesman says “no release of radioactive material” (PHOTO & VIDEO) August 24 photo shows steam rising from multiple locations at quake-hit Virginia nuke plant (PHOTO) ABC News: Virginia nuke plant has to “go to the backup to the backup” power supply — “That doesn’t sound good” (VIDEO)But full power has now been restored.

"all happened for the same reason: cutting safety measures to make an extra buck."I disagree, they have all happened because of cutting safety measures to MAINTAIN margins in response to INFLATION. It is the fault of the central bank.If USA, like Japan, maintain 0% interest rates for too long, capital formation collapses and prices keep rising, without increased income, organizations will eat out their substance like a starving animal. A Fukushima is then inevitable."What You Should Know About Inflation" Henry Hazlitt 1960 http://www.mises.org/story/2914

If you look at say: www.iris.edu/seismon/ there are some significant earthquakes after a period of quiet, that suggests maybe another one may be due in between this one and the one on the reverse of the Rockies. Madrid, anyone? Say 8.3?

Typo: "earthquake censors were previously removed." The sensors may have been removed, but the censors are in full effect!  ;-)
