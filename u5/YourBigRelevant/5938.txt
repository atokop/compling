[Updated at 5:15 p.m. ET] More than 100 homes in north suburban Atlanta were damaged by heavy thunderstorms and possible tornadoes as the remnants of Tropical Storm Lee swept through the area Monday, authorities reported.
At least one person was rescued from the basement of a collapsed home near Woodstock, about 30 miles north of downtown Atlanta, Cherokee County Emergency Management Supervisor Robby Westbrook told CNN. He said sheriff's deputies counted more than 100 homes damaged in a roughly five-mile stretch around the town.
And Cherokee County Fire Department spokesman Tim Cavender said several trees were knocked down around Holly Springs, about five miles north of Woodstock. But there were no immediate reports of injuries, he said.
The National Weather Service issued a series of tornado warnings for the area starting around 2:30 p.m. Tornado sightings and radar indications were reported across the northwest Atlanta suburbs throughout the rest of the afternoon.
[Initial post, 11:45 a.m. ET] Lee whipped up winds, dumped rain and caused severe flooding across a broad swath of the Southeast on Monday even after weakening to a tropical depression.
The storm will bring up to 20 inches of rain to some areas Monday as it moves into southern Mississippi, the National Hurricane Center said.
The threat of flash floods forced authorities in Jackson, Mississippi, to evacuate more than two dozen families from an apartment complex early Monday, Jackson police spokeswoman Colendula Green said. The storm knocked down power lines and trees across the city, officials said Monday.

Comments of the Day:
"Remember when the work day was 9-5?"–fugunancy
"Fareed Zakaria is completely out of touch with reality. Anyone in the U.S. who takes a vacation will be promptly fired. I know for a fact that I'll never take a vacation again for the rest of my working life."–WeirdMN
Hey, America: Take a vacation!
On this Labor Day weekend, columnist Fareed Zakaria urged Americans to take a break, saying that working longer, harder hours does not make for greater productivity. While some CNN.com readers agreed, many more expressed frustration, whether it was because they had no job, because they had no vacation or because they were afraid to use the time they had.
JB said: "It's not that I don't want to take vacation, but that I need a larger severance package. Many of us at my office view vacation as a safety net against layoffs. There have been several, and the severance package is 'generous' from the company perspective, but not if you have put in 10, 15 and 20 years for the company. There is nothing about getting laid off that makes it generous."
Steve Gastin said, "Wish I could get a job after two years of unemployment. Fifteen million unemployed have had enough vacation and are itching for work."Â  Swestey said, "No kidding. Maybe Fareed is stressed out and overworked, but there are plenty of Americans who do not even have jobs (or at least decent ones). Live in the real world for a while, Fareed."

The Pakistani intelligence service has arrested a senior al Qaeda leader who sought to attack targets in the United States, Europe and Australia, the Pakistani military said Monday.
The intelligence service arrested Younis al-Mauretani and two al Qaeda associates in the suburbs of Quetta, Pakistan, the military said in a statement.
Osama bin Laden had asked al-Mauretani "to focus on hitting targets of economic importance in United States of America, Europe and Australia," with U.S. targets including gas and oil pipelines, dams and oil tankers, the statement said.
Security Clearance: Arrest yet one more blow for al Qaeda
Al-Mauretani was also involved in planning multiple attacks on European countries similar to those in Mumbai, India, in 2008, European intelligence officials told CNN last year. The man at the center of the alleged al Qaeda plot, Afghan German Ahmed Sidiqui, was detained in July 2010 and told interrogators that al-Mauretani helped with planning and coordination.
News of the arrest comes six days before the 10th anniversary of al Qaeda's attack on the United States, which killed nearly 3,000 people. It also comes as the United States and its allies have made major strides in its fight against al Qaeda.

An unchecked wildfire southeast of Austin, Texas, destroyed 300 homes, scorched thousands of acres and stretched across a 16-mile area Monday morning, authorities said.
Another blaze in eastern Texas killed a mother and her 18-month-old child when flames engulfed their mobile home Sunday near Gladewater, the Gregg County Sheriff's Department said.
The fires were among more than 35 across the state, the Texas Forest Service said Monday. Officials said low relative humidity and strong winds from Lee, which made landfall as a tropical storm but has weakened to a tropical depression, fanned the flames.

Former President George W. Bush says he experienced no pleasure when he heard about the death of Osama bin Laden, the al Qaeda leader responsible for orchestrating the deadly terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.
"He was sitting in a restaurant in Dallas when the Secret Service told him that President (Barack) Obama wanted to speak to him. He then learned about the assassination," documentarian Peter Schnall told CNN in an interview set to air Monday.
Bush "said to us certainly there was no sense of jubilation (and) certainly no sense of happiness," Schnall stressed. "If anything, he felt that finally there was a sense of closure."

It's Labor Day, a day that honors all the contributions workers make to the well-being of the United States.Â  For many of you, Labor Day is a work-free holiday.Â  So, while you're out enjoying your barbecues and last days of Summer, we thought we would bring back some videos that highlight some less than exemplary members of the workforce.Â Â 
Curse-and-slide technique – It's almost impossible to forget the infamous JetBlue flight attendant who gained notoriety in 2010 for his ability to quit in truly spectacular fashion.Â  Forget giving two-week notice. This guy cursed out a customer, grabbed a beer and slid down the emergency chute.

The International Committee of the Red Cross has been granted access to a detention facility in Syria for the first time since unrest broke out in the country, the committee's president said Monday after meeting with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
ICRC President Jakob Kellenberger called the breakthrough "an important step forward for our humanitarian activities in Syria."
Kellenberger's meeting with al-Assad occurred amid mounting reports of bloodshed by Syrian security forces.
On Monday, security forces killed six people during an ongoing crackdown in the province of Homs, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition activist group.
Syria has been engulfed in public protest for months, and the regime has been accused internationally of a crackdown on peaceful demonstrators. The government has maintained that it is targeting armed terrorists. But opposition activists say it is a systematic, sustained slaughter.
"Ensuring that the sick and the wounded have access to medical care will be among the particularly urgent humanitarian challenges to be addressed with the Syrian authorities," the Red Cross said in a statement.
The committee will initially be allowed to see only people detained by the Ministry of Interior, Kellenberger said, adding, "We are hopeful that we will soon be able to visit all detainees.

Lee Roy Selmon, a Pro Football Hall of Fame defensive end who was the Tampa Bay Buccaneersâ first-ever draft pick, died Sunday after suffering a stroke two days earlier, the team said.
The 56-year-old had been admitted to a Tampa, Florida, hospital after suffering the stroke Friday.
Selmon, a two-time national champion and three-time All-American at Oklahoma University, played nine seasons after the expansion Buccaneers made him the first overall pick in the 1976 draft. He was named NFL Defensive Player of the Year in 1979, when the Bucs made it to the NFC championship game.
He still is the teamâs all-time leader in sacks (78.5) and forced fumbles (28.5) and is the only Hall of Fame member to have played all of his seasons with Tampa Bay.
âHe not only helped define the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, but established himself as one of the best ever at the defensive end position,â Steve Perry, president of the Hall of Fame, said on the hallâs website.

On a week that Americans take a holiday to honor workers, President Barack Obama and a prominent GOP challenger for the White House are scheduled to unveil their plans to create jobs in a country with a 9.1 percent unemployment rate. Here is a look at this and other stories that CNN plans to follow this week:
Obama, Romney to detail jobs plans
In front of a joint session of Congress on Thursday, President Barack Obama is expected to deliver a plan to create jobs and strengthen the economy , including longstanding proposals to boost infrastructure projects; complete free trade deals with South Korea, Colombia and Panama; and extend unemployment benefits.
White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters last week to expect the president to announce both unilateral steps he can take and legislative proposals that would require passage by Congress.

An emperor penguin that lost its way from Antarctica more than two months ago was released back into his native Southern Ocean waters Sunday.
"It's an indescribable feeling to see a patient finally set free," said Dr. Lisa Argilla, manager of veterinary science at Wellington Zoo, where the bird has been recuperating since New Zealanders discovered it in June on a beach north of the capital city.
Argilla said the penguin, nicknamed "Happy Feet" after the 2006 animated movie about emperor penguins, needed "some gentle encouragement" to slide down a ramp off the research vessel that transported it back home.

In 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court declared all laws establishing segrated schools unconstitutional. That meant African-American students could legally attendÂ all-white schools. By 1957,Â the NAACP registered a group of nine black students to attend Little Rock Central High School in Arkansas.Â  The school board agreed to comply with the 1954 ruling and approved a plan for gradual integration that would start that school year.Â 
On September 4,Â that group of students, later nicknamed the "Little Rock 9," attempted to enter Central High on the first day of school, but a crowd of angry students and hundreds of National Guardsmen blocked them from entering. The incident grabbed national attention - and the attention of President Eisenhower. As a result, the nine students attended the school under federal protection, opening the door for black students across the country. In today's Gotta Watch, we're featuring highlights from that historic day and reaction from the Little Rock 9 as they look back on their experiences three decades later.
A day that changed history – Take a look at this historical footage from the very day the so-called Little Rock 9 were blocked from entering their school.

Documents seized at the Libyan intelligence headquarters have revealed a surprisingly close relationship between the CIA and their counterparts in the regime of Moammar Gadhafi.
They highlight the cooperation between Libya and Western intelligence agencies after Libya ended its weapons of mass destruction program in 2004. They also shed light on the West's controversial rendition program - the questioning of terror suspects in third-party countries.
CNN saw documents in the former office of Libya's external security agency and received material from Human Rights Watch on Saturday. They are from 2004 and 2005.

Blue Angels to fly on biofuels

When the six F/A-18 Hornets in the U.S. Navy's Blue Angels flight demonstration team thrill the crowds at the Naval Air Station Patuxent River Air Expo in Maryland this weekend, they'll be soaring on biofuel.
Each of the six Hornets will be powered by a 50/50-blend of jet fuel and camelina-based biofuel, according to a Navy press release.
Camelina is a high-oil flowering plant grown in rotation on land used for wheat and on land too marginal for food production, according to Sustainable Oils, the company providing it to the military. Sustainable Oils says camelina can also reduce carbon emissions by 80% over jet fuel.
The camelina mix has been successfully tested in several military aircraft, including the Air Force's A-10 Thunderbolt, F-15 Eagle, F-22 Raptor and C-17 Globemaster, as well as the Navy F/A-18. Two Air Force F-16s from the Thunderbirds demonstration team flew with the mix during a performance in May, the service and Sustainable Fuels said.
"This will be the first time an entire unit has flown on a biofuel mix," Navy Secretary Ray Mabus said in the Navy release. "Changing the kinds of fuels we use and the way we use them is critical to assuring the Navy and Marine Corps remain the most formidable expeditionary fighting force the world has ever known."
By 2016, the Navy plans to deploy the Great Green Fleet, an aircraft carrier strike group powered entirely by non-fossil fuels, Mabus has said.

Ohio mom who put kids in wrong school was 'deceitful,' parole board says

The Ohio Parole Board unanimously recommended against clemency for a mother who lied about her residency so her children could attend school tuition-free in another district.
Kelley Williams-Bolar admitted in a July hearing that she was wrong to enroll her two daughters in the Copley-Fairlawn school district from under her father's address while she lived in subsidized housing in Akron. She claimed she did so because she did not want to leave her daughters home alone after school while she was attending classes at The University of Akron, fearing for their safety after a 2006 burglary.
The eight-panel board concluded that she could have investigated other options, such as looking at other districts, asking friends or neighbors to babysit, or actually moving into her parents' home. Instead, she chose "a pattern of deceitful behavior," the Board wrote in its clemency report, released Friday.
"Ms. Williams-Bolar was faced with a no more difficult situation than any other working parent who must ensure that their children are safe during, before and after school hours in their absence," it said in its ruling. "Most parents find legitimate and legal options to address this issue. Ms. Williams-Bolar's only response was to be deceitful."
The recommendation goes on to Gov. John Kasich, who expressed sympathy for Williams-Bolar earlier this year after her sentencing.
"Although we are disappointed with the Parole Board's recommendation, we remain confident that justice will ultimately prevail," Williams-Bolar's lawyer, David Singleton, said. "The Governor, not the Parole Board, has the last word on Kelley's clemency petition."

[6:35 p.m. ET] A state of emergency has been declared in Biloxi, Mississippi, in anticipation of Tropical Storm Lee, Mayor AJ Holloway told CNN.
[2:30 p.m. ET] A slow-moving tropical system with the potential to douse summer-ending beach plans and bring up to 20 inches of flooding rain to parts of the Gulf Coast strengthened into a tropical storm Friday afternoon, according to the National Hurricane Center.
Tropical Storm Lee could bring winds of 65 mph when it makes landfall this weekend, CNN meteoroloigist Sean Morris said.
The state of Louisiana and 10 of its parishes had declared states of emergency as of Friday afternoon, Gov. Bobby Jindal said. LaFourche Parish and the city of Grand Isle also issued voluntary evacuation orders, he said.
"This is going to be a slow-moving storm. It's going to bring a lot of rain," Jindal said.
Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour also declared a state of emergency for portions of southern Mississippi expected to be affected by the storm.
The storm was likely to reach land in the next 48 hours, forecasters said.
The storm is over water as warm as 90 degrees and atmospheric conditions that are limiting its development should become more favorable to strengthening over the next 24 hours, CNN meteorologist Sean Morris said.
Tropical storm-force winds are being reported at several oil rigs in the Gulf, according to Morris and the National Hurricane Center.
The current track suggests a possible landfall west of Morgan City, Louisiana on Sunday morning, Morris said.
Tropical storm warnings were up for the Gulf coast from Pascagoula, Mississippi to Sabine Pass, Texas.
