Conservatives Can't Decide If Obama Was Too Busy Golfing Or Biking To Stop The Earthquake
August 23, 2011  2:29 pm ET by Media Matters staff

Following the 5.8 magnitude earthquake that shook the D.C. region
this afternoon, conservative media figures have responded the only way they
know how: by twisting it into an attack on Obama's vacation in Martha's
Vineyard.
Gateway Pundit Jim Hoft put up a post announcing, "Earthquake
Rattles Washington DC - Obama Goes Biking":

Meanwhile, Matt Drudge's above-the-fold coverage of the
earthquake featured a series of links about the story and a link telling readers that "Obama
was on golf course..."

"Developing."

                    So let me see if I have this straight: a minor earthquake and Obama is supposed to drop everything and run back to DC.

Terrorists fly planes into the WTC and Bush sits on his ass reading "The Pet Goat" and that's OK and nobody better say anything otherwise about it. Ah, let him finish, he was just getting to the really good part.

                    I understand that it was a rupture of the "Bush Fault".  Obama says economy and jobs to plummet as the headwinds mount!

                    You have a point.  Obama completely disregarded his Presidential Daily Briefing titled "Earthquake determined to attack within the US".

                    When the world ends the liberal-socialists will still be shrieking that it's all Bush's fault.

Anything to deflect from the total incompetence & stupidity of that moron "community organizer" they elected.

Going on vacation, appearing on Oprah, playing golf, spending money, blaming bad luck for his mistakes, smiling and letting sewage spill out of that smelly cave that hangs under his nose is the sum total of Obama's achievments.

PS.  They 9/11 attacks were being planned for years before Bush came into office.  John O'Neill of the FBI was hot on their trail until various Clinton stooges sabotaged his career for being too much of a maverick.  Watch the Frontline documentary "The Man Who Knew Too Much" and you will discover for yourself who shoulders the blame for that terrorist attack.

                    I'm gonna assume you hit your head pretty hard during the earthquake.

In the meantime, I have complied responses from many
Republicans commenting on the ObamaQuake.

It was his "fault" ya know.

                    We already saw that documentary.  I think you watched a bizarro world version.  

Also, rather pathetic of you to rant on like that saying nothing of substance, but fairly typical.

You are a LIAR. We are not as stupid as you. We never will be so we will not act like you. You are STILL far too stupid to know what a socialist is. Why do you compound your already formidible ignorance by using words you do not understand the meaning of?

Anything is an excuse for you to tell more hateful lies. That is what you do. That is who you are a pathetic ignorant LIAR.

PS you are a LIAR. You spew out long ago debunked nonsense. It was Bush who got rid of the Osama unit. You just dont care one bit whether what you say is true or not as long as it is hateful and ignorant. You are a LIAR. I guess since you have a complete lack of decency you always will be a LIAR.

                    If Bush had followed through on the instructions left him by the Clinton administration to go after Al Qaeda for the USS Cole bombing, Osama bin Laden wouldn't have been convinced that the USA would lie there and take it without so much as a peep.

If Bush hadn't thrown away the anti-terrorism plan, they would have been working on anti-terrorism plan before 9/11. If he hadn't failed to make fighting terrorism job#1, who knows what would have happened.

Maybe he couldn't have stopped it. But if he had done his job, if he hadn't rejected those things simply because they came to him as suggestions from Clinton's staff, we wouldn't criticize him for rejecting those suggestions and ignoring the hair on fire warnings!

                    Pilot tells another really STUPID lie. No one is suprised. Making up unbelievably stupid things to say about Obama and the left is just what he does. Pilot is a liar. He has no decency. He doesnt even have a political ideology. He just hates. Hates Obama hates the left. He knows he is too stupid to make an actual argument so he lies pretty much all the time. Sometimes, like this he just says something blazingly stupid, and deludes himself he is clever.

You are a pathetic and worthless excuse for a human being pilot

                    Mineral, Virginia--the epicenter of the quake--is in Eric Cantor's congressional district.  

THANKS, ERIC CANTOR!

                    You can't blame this on Cantor; during the quake he was concentrating on his primary concern.  He is in Israel.  http://www2.starexponent.com/news/2011/aug/20/rep-cantor-put-your-constituents-economic-concerns-ar-1250435/

                    Obama struck his golf club in the ground because he was so frustrated with the republicans blocking all his attempts to improve the quality of life for Americans and create jobs.

God answered swiftly with a job creating earthquake....Hallerlewyer, as Madea would say!

                    Cuz if Obama was in the White House, he could have stopped the earthquake!  

Hoft never, ever, continues to get better (worse.)  I can't fathom what he'll do to top this, but I know he'll think of something! 

Tomorrow, we'll hear from Beck how this was a sign of some sort.

                    Oh wait a minute. I almost forgot the rightwing nutjobs over at HotAir (Mark Knoller) already did this one:

"Contrast: Iranian Protestors Shot As Obama Goes for Ice Cream" For the kicker - just check the timestamps. Obama went for ice cream at the very least a half an hour before any tweet or other information came out regarding violence in Iran. This is the modern right wing, though. Obama should have known and/or the entire concept of linear time is merely sciency balderdash!

                    The Presidents top seismologists give him a daily briefing on seismic activity all over the world. However every briefing is the same "Ehm Mr. President we havent got a clue when or where the next earthquake will strike. But please please Mr. President dont go biking with your family just in case!"

"...please please Mr. President dont go biking with your family just in case!"--galmudI agree the optics would look bad. In fact, the optics aren't good if you do any number of things including "going for a walk", "playing with the dog", "brushing teeth", "reading a book", "listening to iPod", "sitting on the john" ...etc.

What exactly do these morons think the President should have been doing while an unpredictable event like an earthquake is going on?

                    George W. Bush was actually riding a bicycle when a small plane invaded the Capitol's airspace creating mass confusion and evacuation.  Bush was not told of the incident until almost one-half hour later when he returned because his SS detail didn't want to disturb Mr. Bush's bike riding.

The Obamas rode this morning and, after assurance that there were only minor damages, Obama played golf.  Something that people do on their vacations.

                    Come on, its not like there was mass devastation and death. Obama got a phone call during his gold game and was updated on the situation. What more do you want him to do? He can't fly back to DC since all flights have been grounded.

Either one is just plain ridiculous and the fact that there is an audience for this nonsense is truly sad.

                    I think he is saying that this tragedy almost happened and Obama does not care enough to stop riding his bicycle.

BTW, I am here in Atlanta in a 10 story building. I did not feel anything at all.

                    That's obviously because you're an unfeeling liberal. (Do I really need the /sarc tag?)

                    The media could at least acknowledge the irony that the only time anything in Washington gets moving is while Congress is on recess and the President is out of town.

((Since we have no reports of injuries I figure it still okay to joke about it a little))

Earthquake? The Lord was expressing His anger over the Rev. Jim Hagee's comments about Katrina.

                    The least Obama could do is to interrupt his golf game long enough to say:

"I call upon all nations to do everything they can to stop these seismic killers. Thank you. Now watch this drive."

Yep.  You got it kabnut.  For a freak, you sure are perceptive kabnut. 

I know that come November 2012, you will be even more mentally dysfunctional kabnut. That's when us adults will be back in charge and try our damndest to fix the horrible damage that Obama has done to our once proud Country.

                    Obama should have known that an earthquake was going to happen!  Because, as we all know, earthquakes have just as much warning as hurricanes.

                    Obama was golfing right while he and his advisers were finalizing plans to take out Bin laden. As far as I am concerned, he can move the Oval office to a golf course.

                    Are you referring to bin Laden's death, the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, the creation of more private-sector jobs than the entirety of the Bush presidency, credit card reform, ending rescission, increased funding for the Violence Against Women Act, the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, voluntary disclosure of White House visitors, the START Treaty, or ending the ridiculous, antiquated DADT policy?

                    Never content to rest on his laurels as America's dumbest typist, Jim Hoft inspires us daily by working tirelessly to not just stay in first place, but to actually increase his lead! We should praise Hoft's dedication to his craft.  Few in America display this man's single-minded devotion to his cause.

                    I usually stick to just commenting on the economic pieces on Media Matters, but when I see a sensational headline I check it out to see if Media Matters hasn't once again posted a story that does not match their headline.  And, of course, they have.

To support the headline "Conservatives Can't Decide If Obama Was Too Busy Golfing Or Biking To Stop The Earthquake", Media Matters includes a screen shot from a blogger few people have heard of, and a screen shot from The Drudge Report -- neither of which makes any mention of Obama being too busy to stop the earthquake.  Both just mentioned where Obama was, which is a reasonable thing to mention given that the earthquake affected essentially the entire east coast and people may have been wondering where the President was and if he was okay.

                    Looks to me, JB, as if you trogs desperately need that "nanny state" you claim to despise.  The President got the reports, saw damage was minimal, with no casualties, and went about his business, leaving the brave and free to go about theirs.  And you have a problem with that?  Sad.

                    I don't have a problem with that.  I never said I did.  There wasn't anything Obama could've or should've done.  I was just pointing out how Media Matters put out a sensational headline stating, "Conservatives Can't Decide If Obama Was Too Busy Golfing Or Biking To Stop The Earthquake", when the examples they provided do not support the headline.  

Those types of misleading headlines, as well selectively editing quotes, is becoming a pattern on Media Matters -- rather ironic for a site which attempts to discredit Fox News for doing those things.

Wow - that is taking disingenuous to a new level!  Neither headline said the president was okay.  Instead, each made a point of saying that Obama was doing some leisure-type activity, clearly implying that Obama didn't care enough about the earthquake.  If you had one iota of intellectual honesty you would admit that, instead of making this lame defense.

                    I'm sorry, but I don't think the goal was to inform people that the president was safe. The headline wasn't "Earthquake hits, Obama OK". The goal was to discredit him by making him appear uncaring or disinterested about the earthquake when, as you said yourself, there is nothing he could have or should have done about it.

I'll allow that MMFA's headline can be read as having certain level of disingenuity (although I read it as snark, as did many others I assume), but if you think Obama's golfing was brought up as "a reasonable thing to mention" because "people may have may have been wondering...if he was okay", you're clearly not too familiar with the right wing media. The implications here were more than subtle.

                    Let's assume that the these reports are true--
Obama can
--cause earthquakes
--cause the economy to collapse
--cause all sorts of political unrest
--could cause the downfall of the US

In their fearful way of looking at the world, shouldn't they do everything they can to appease the person who has all this power?  Wouldn't it be in their best interest to be nice and to do everything they can to placate the president?  If these are the things they know about, what malevolent things can Obama do that they do not even know of?  Maybe the president could determine the winner of the superbowl?  Or determine the winner of Nascar events? They should be careful, very careful of what they say.  They should want to be one of his friends.
