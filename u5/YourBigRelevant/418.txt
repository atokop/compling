In Washington DC, the White House, the Pentagon and the US Capitol were all evacuated. The tremor has affected flights, trains and phone services across the US, while a nuclear reactor was shut down. Officials are now assessing the damage to property.

WASHINGTON - A 5.9 magnitude earthquake centered northwest of Richmond, Va., shook much of Washington, DC, and was felt as far north as Rhode Island, New York City and Martha's Vineyard, Mass., where President Barack Obama is vacationing. The US Geological Survey said the earthquake was half a mile deep. Shaking was felt at the White House and all over the East Coast, as far south as Chapel Hill, NC Parts of the Pentagon, White House and Capitol were evacuated. There were no immediate reports of injuries. The Pentagon was later deemed safe for reoccupation. The quake was centered near Louisa, Va., in Louisa County, which is northwest of Richmond and south of Washington. Obama and many of the nation's leaders were out of town on August vacation when the quake struck at 1:51 pm EDT. The shaking was felt on the Martha's Vineyard golf course as Obama was just starting a round. The East Coast gets earthquakes, but usually smaller ones and is less prepared than California or Alaska for shaking. At Reagan National Airport outside Washington, ceiling tiles fell during a few seconds of shaking. Authorities announced it was an earthquake and all flights were put on hold.
