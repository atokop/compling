9-year-old boy injured on Maryland State Fair ride

By  The Associated Press


An emergency services official says a 9-year-old boy was injured when he tried to get off a small swing ride at the Maryland State Fair while the ride was still operating.
Michael Huber, coordinator of emergency services at the event in Timonium, says the child was injured Saturday. Huber said the boy is from the Baltimore area, but didn’t identify him or provide any details on his injuries.
Huber says the child was taken to the Johns Hopkins Pediatric Intensive Care Unit. He told The Baltimore Sun the injury was the most serious this year at the fair, which ends Monday.

Va. church near quake’s center to rebuild

By  The Associated Press


Members of the tiny congregation of a church rocked by a Virginia-centered earthquake are launching a fund-drive to restore their sanctuary.
The 5.8-magnitude quake Aug. 23 rocked the Gilboa Christian Church in Cuckoo, which is located near the epicenter of the quake in Mineral. The church dates to 1857 and has between 50 and 75 members.
“It’s just heartbreaking,” Peggy Albright, who has attended services at the church for nearly 80 years, told The Daily Progress of Charlottesville.
Church members agreed to raise an estimated $350,000 to restore the church, which suffered structural damage. The congregation was to meet at a nearby community center Sunday to worship.
Church leaders are asking for donations from the community and beyond to help rebuild.
“We know the congregation is the church, not the building,” said John Turner, pastor of this flock for more than 25 years. “The mission of the church will continue as we work to rebuild.”
The earthquake cracked the sanctuary’s four walls, making it unsafe to use. Volunteers over the Labor Day weekend planned to salvage what they could from the building, then start working on ways to shore up the sides until they can start to rebuild.
“We’re told that in terms of safety, the entire walls of the original church will have to be torn down and rebuilt,” Turner said. “The hope is to rebuild the church as close to the way it looked before the earthquake.”
Eugenia Bumpass, 96, who has attended the church for more than 30 years, still drives herself to church services or carpools with other ladies from the church.
“This is a family church,” Bumpass said. “There have been a lot of families who have given to this church and who have been attending all of their lives.”
It’s expected to take up to a year to rebuild the sanctuary.

Va. sailor rescued during Irene arrested a 2nd time

By  The Associated Press




						(Michael S. Williamson - THE WASHINGTON POST)
					A man rescued from his sailboat during Hurricane Irene has been arrested for the second time.
The Norfolk Sheriff’s office said Michael Calabrese was arrested Thursday and charged with damage to property and public drunkenness. He was released on $500 bond, according to The Virginian-Pilot.
The 48-year-old Calabrese had been released from jail Wednesday after an arrest last Sunday on a trespassing charge at the Bayview Recreation Center.
Calabrese and his girlfriend, Gina Sullivan, were rescued Aug. 27 from the 42-foot yacht Maybe Tomorrow. The boat remains beached, and the city and Calabrese are trying to work out how to remove it.

Pinball Museum likely moving from D.C. to Baltimore

By  The Associated Press




						(Astrid Riecken - FOR THE WASHINGTON POST)
					The National Pinball Museum is likely moving to Baltimore by year’s end after it lost its lease in Georgetown and couldn’t find another affordable space in Washington.
Museum founder David Silverman says he is negotiating a lease for a building near Baltimore’s Inner Harbor. He says Baltimore is proving to be more receptive of his museum than Washington.
The museum opened last December in the Shops at Georgetown Park. But the mall’s owner plans to renovate the building and told Silverman he had to go. He hopes to finalize a Baltimore deal by the end of September.
The museum’s last day operating in Georgetown is Monday, and the museum will offer free admission.
Silverman owns about 800 pinball machines and has more than 200 on exhibit.

Va. zoo’s 19-year-old snow leopard dies

By  The Associated Press


Boris, the Mill Mountain Zoo’s male snow leopard, has died.
Zoo officials told The Roanoke Times that they euthanized the 19-year-old leopard Friday after he had failed to respond to treatment.
He wasn’t eating well or moving and was receiving pain medication for comfort.
Boris arrived at the zoo in 1996, giving visitors a chance to see an endangered species. About 5,000 snow leopards remain in the wild.
The zoo has another snow leopard, China, who arrived there last year.

Maryland officials: Hurricane Irene didn’t kill our chickens

By  Maggie Fazeli Fard



Maryland’s chickens survived Hurricane Irene, but 57,000 poultry deaths have been reported in Delaware.
						(Seth Perlman - AP)
					Despite earlier reports that 30,000 Maryland chickens perished in Hurricane Irene, state agriculture officials say there were no poultry deaths in Maryland due to the storm. 
Julie Oberg, a spokeswoman for the Maryland Department of Agriculture, told the Associated Press Thursday that the erroneous report was a mix-up resulting from a conference call with Delaware officials. 
The Delaware State Veterinarian’s Office has received reports of 57,000 poultry deaths due to Irene, said the AP. 
Maryland’s chickens weren’t quite so lucky in 1999, when Hurricane Floyd drowned thousands of them.

Fire in Upper Marlboro townhouses displaces 11

By  Maggie Fazeli Fard




						(Fire Chief Marc S.Bashoor - Prince George’s County Fire/EMS Department)
					A fire ripped through a complex of townhouses in Upper Marlboro late Thursday night, displacing 11 people, including one infant. 
Prince George’s County firefighters were called to the 3000 block of Chester Grove Road at approximately 11:15 p.m., officials said. Upon arriving, they saw that the fire had spread from the first floor of the complex to the second. 
When flames caused the front wall of second-floor room to collapse, firefighters evacuated and regrouped, officials said. 
None of the residents were injured. Four units were badly damaged before the fire was extinguished. The effort involved a total of 50 firefighters and took approximately 45 minutes.
Officials said they have not yet confirmed the cause of the fire, but an investigation is underway.
