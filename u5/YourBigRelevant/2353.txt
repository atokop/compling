6 Strange Anomalies With The Virginia Earthquake







USGS Shakemap Image
Eric Blair
Activist Post

My first thought upon hearing the news of the rare 5.9 magnitude earthquake in Virginia this week was that it was not a natural occurrence. After all, no one has ever felt or even heard of such a powerful temblor happening in this area in a lifetime. As is usual for my cynical instincts, I hoped that I was wrong. However, several anomalies indicate that something is not normal with the Virginia quake.

First, I spend a lot of time in the "Ring of Fire" zone and have experienced numerous earthquakes.  By no means does this make me an expert, nor scientifically qualified to analyze earthquakes.  But, as enthusiasts, we looked up every quake we felt over a five-year period -- the size, epicenter location, depth, and so on, to get a general sense of placing how it "felt" relative to the official data.


I can categorically state that, of the dozen or so earthquakes that I've experienced, including a powerful 6.2, all of them started gently, none of them were over 50 miles away, all of them had depths of several kilometers, and the big ones seemed to have multiple aftershocks reported. Again, I say this as an observer, not as a scientist, and I'm only providing this background simply to qualify my immediate skepticism.

Furthermore, curiously, the "Great Virginia Quake of 2011," unprecedented in size and scope, should have grabbed the media headlines and discussion for weeks, but Hurricane Irene has all but wiped the earthquake off the weather map.  Even as all the storm measurements for Irene show that it will likely be a minor nuisance, maybe some flooding and power outages, multiple states of emergency have been declared, mandatory mass evacuations ordered, and the media is all too eager to spread the panic.  You'd think the east coast of the United States was being invaded.  It feels like a distraction, or perhaps a large but manageable live drill of some kind to make heroes out of our politicians, and FEMA look like a successful agency.

If this manic and surreal coverage of Irene is a deliberate distraction, the anomalies regarding the recent earthquake may have provided sufficient motivation for doing so.  Not to discount other establishment catastrophes that they may want to distract from at this critical time -- like the crumbling economy, record political disapproval, and the bungled invasion of Tripoli -- but, if any discussion about the unusual nature of the earthquake was allowed one must ponder if some sort of manipulation was involved.  The establishment will not permit such talk, apparently; hence the rapid about-face on earthquake coverage.

Below are six abnormalities about the Virginia earthquake that should warrant further investigation:



Advertisement
Location: The location is the most obvious anomaly for such a powerful quake. Although the area of the U.S. where the earthquake initiated sits on the edge of an ancient tectonic plate called the Craton Plate, it is considered a relatively dormant or settled area.  In other words, it's not a very active earthquake zone.  Therefore, any noticeable earthquake is unusual, let alone a 5.9 monster that was reportedly felt 500 miles away. Furthermore, if one is inclined to believe that earthquakes can be manipulated, the epicenter occurring close to Washington D.C. (with all its sensitive military and government infrastructure) raises some suspicions. Admittedly, that's conjecture, but considering the following oddities it might be more believable by the end of the article.

Unusually Shallow Depth:  The initial hypocenter (depth) of the quake reported by the establishment media was, wait for it, wait for it, only 0.1 miles or about 528 feet (161 meters) deep. That's right, AFP announced the depth with certainty, "The Pentagon, the US Capitol and monuments in the nation's capital were all evacuated after the 5.9-magnitude quake, which was shallow with its epicenter only 0.1 miles underground."  The depth was later adjusted to a more believable 3.7 miles (5.95 kilometers) beneath the surface. Still, shallow-focus quakes usually only occur in areas abundant in seismic activity, like the ring of fire. And the depths of those shallow-focus earthquakes are usually in the tens of kilometers deep.  The Earth's crust in the Eastern U.S. where "the fault lines are more healed" is described by CBS News as "older and colder" than out West. Which, according to Wikipedia, means it should have been a deep-focus earthquake with a depth ranging from 300 to 700 kilometers.  Certainly not one barely below the Earth's surface.

Odd Seismograph Reading:  A reporter from Press Core received an anonymous email from someone claiming to be in the U.S. Air Force that stated the Virginia earthquake “wasn’t a natural earthquake and not a HAARP earthquake."  The reporter was instructed to find a seismograph of the Washington DC area earthquake and compare it to a past earthquakes and seismic readings of the alleged underground nuclear test by North Korea that resulted in a 4.7 magnitude tremor at a depth of zero.



Seismograph of Virginia quake in green -- Washington and Lee University (85 miles from epicenter)
Press Core writes, the green lines indicate the blunt tremor that was felt in Washington D.C. and the black lines are a transparent overlay of a normal earthquake seismograph from a pdf file from Virginia Division Mineral Resources on Earthquakes.  That file describes a typical natural occurring earthquake as:
When a fault ruptures, energy is released in the form of seismic waves. The first waves to reach the earth’s surface are primary or 'P' waves (Figure 2). P waves are compressional waves that travel at a speed of about four miles per second near the surface – faster as depth increases. The next waves to reach the earth’s surface are secondary or 'S' waves. S waves are shear waves that move at a speed of about 1.5 miles per second. P and S waves are body waves that travel through the earth much like sonar waves travel through water. Surface waves, which are slower than S waves, travel along the surface of the earth much like waves at the surface of the ocean. S waves and surface waves cause the most destruction at the earth’s surface.The article concludes; "What is missing from the seismograph for the Washington DC area 5.8 magnitude earthquake are the primary or 'P' waves.  All earthquakes that are the direct result of fault rupture have these primary or 'P' waves.  Nuclear detonations do not."

Distance Felt: As my introduction stated, I've never "felt" an earthquake whose epicenter was farther than 50 miles away.  Of course, this doesn't mean that it's not possible, as clearly this was felt upwards of 500 miles from the epicenter.  The CBS article quoted above that referred to the crust as "older and colder" also uses that argument to explain why tremors were felt so far away: "The East is far less seismically active -- but when earthquakes do hit, that hard ground is far more effective at conducting the seismic waves. When you hit it, it rings like a bell," said Christopher Scholz a professor of geophysics at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory."  This seems a bit contradictory given the shallow depth of the quake, but there may be some validity to the "bell" theory.  The fact remains, earthquakes whose effects travel long distances are uncommon, hence the reason for the CBS article about why the quake was so "widely felt."

'Remarkably Low' Number of Aftershocks:  Amy Vaughan, a geophysicist with the USGS Earthquake Information Center in Colorado told CBS News that "For the size earthquake that occurred, I think the number of aftershocks so far has been remarkably low." Don Blakeman, another geophysicist at the Earthquake Information Center, added "Typically, the larger the quake, the longer and the greater extent of aftershocks. Shallow earthquakes like the one in Virginia also tend to generate numerous aftershocks."  The lack of aftershocks led the USGS to report that the Virginia quake may be just a foreshock of something larger to come. A foreshock is an earthquake that occurs before a larger seismic event (the mainshock) and is related to it in both time and space.  I'm not sure what this means other than it's just another abnormality about this quake.



Image source - Enterprise Mission
Instantaneously Knocked Irene Off Course: Kevin Hayden and Glenn Kreisberg reported "Coincidentally, the time frame leading up to Virginia/DC/New York area experiencing freak seismic activity, Hurricane Irene begins to weaken and move off course, avoiding its initial path of Havanna, inland Florida, the Carolinas, and eventually, the Washington, DC area. The newly projected paths show that it may barely clip the eastern coast, if at all. Just as Ophelia did when it threatened the same region."  Irene stalled and changed directions similar to Ophelia seen in the graphic provided.  Clearly, these types of drastic changes are not a natural path for hurricanes.

A few articles have speculated that HAARP earthquake weapons were to blame, in conjunction with manipulating hurricane Irene. Indeed, when one knows even the basic capabilities of HAARP, this does not seem too far-fetched.  Press Core seems to think the seismic data proves it was more similar to an underground nuclear detonation.  One thing is for sure, the mysterious characteristics of the Virginia quake seem to indicate that it was not a typical earthquake.

Good morning and I want to thank you for including my bit of research in your excellent report on the anomalies involved with the Virginia quake.Secondly, I want to state that while I believe HAARP to be involved in the interesting "tuning fork interference patterns" witnessed in Hurricanes Ophelia AND Irene, I am very interested in this theory of a possible nuclear detonation underground in the northeast as cause for the quake.I was talking with several people just last night about this very theory as we were on the topic of underground military bases.  The lack of aftershocks, the wave propagation noted on the seismic graph, and the shallow depth (which I, too, read plenty of initial reports stating 0.1 miles - which means SOMEone with authority stated this early on, perhaps out of lockstep with the planned "story").Roughly two years ago, the northwest experienced numerous small quakes, in and around the 3.0 magnitude and after a week or so of this, a grid-pattern began to emerge as to the epicenters.  When I noticed this, I began suspecting underground detonations of some sort...again, perhaps for underground military bases or bunkers?  It's no conspiracy theory as to the existence of underground bases.  They exist and many, for good reason.  Cheyenne Mountain, in Colorado, is a prime example as it houses NORAD.  The underground landscape and large highways underneath the Denver airport is no secret and I could imagine - although I'm certainly not an explosives expert - that in some areas, it might be required to chisel through the granite or rock at certain depths.Did elements of our government detonate a large explosive as they burrowed through deep layers of the Earth, building some massive ark-cave or underground bunker for our lovely Globalist politicians? It is certainly an interesting concept.Thanks for posting the seismic data!Keep up the good fight,Kevin HaydenFounder, TruthisTreason.net

Thanks for the article.  I took a class on geology years ago but I'd forgotten about earthquake propagation patterns, so the graph is extremely interesting.  The other thing I thought was weird about this quake was that DC was warned in advance and had already evacuated prior to it.  How did they know?

Though Steve Quayle puts up some questionable material, some of which doesn't come to pass, he is a carrier of some decent information as well.He's suggested an underground nuclear detonation, and looking at the data, I would agree that makes most sense. Doesn't look like HAARP and doesn't bear the mark of natural earthquakes. Only time will tell.http://www.stevequayle.com/News.alert/11_Global/110825.alert.nukes.html

Thank you for your excellent article. I've been following this closely and found new info in it. I felt it in NE Tennessee up in the mountains. I went through the 1971 7.0 or so earthquake in Los Angeles, CA. It lasted a full minute and started as a slow rumble so I know what you're talking about. Nuclear detonation is certainly a possibility. So is fracking and maybe even Comet Elenin. Hard to tell. I saw a video that explained about the craton and the shifting tectonic plates which I can also see happening. But the seismograph sure makes me wonder if it was nuclear detonation. Great article, thanks!

One part that I found interesting about this is the amazing coincidence that this occurred near so many government installations in a geographic area overrun with government. And it is curious that all the hoopla about the hurricane is pushing this story to the back burner.

I'd like to see more seismographic stuff. The seismographic stuff from WTC was also very interesting. There must be more graphs from university or research centers on the East coast.That graph looks like a shock wave, not an earthquake. I felt lots in Japan. They build, peak and decay. That just hit full force and decayed.

first of all you idiots, if you spent as much time out in the real world as you do sitting your asses at your desk searching for bullcrap answers to suit your agenda's, you will find how much you actually dont know. Dc did not evacuate PRIOR to the quake. I was there. The pentagon was evactuated AFTER the tremor. Secondly, why have none of you idiots produced a geiger count of this supposed nuclear explosion? Something that large would certainly leave traces both below and above ground. Whooshing sound indeed. I can not beleive the drivel I see here. A comet? That was the stupidest thing I have ever heard of. Every single country in the world would have reported that one. Also, I was here in NOVA during the hurricane and it certainly did not graze us. It was a full on hit. I am going to hazard a bet and say most if not all of you are pimple assed, fat asses living in your mothers basements dreaming of ways to get back at a society that you choose not to be a part of because your weak minds and wills allow you to do nothing productive in life.

Eric, I am in agreement with your observations "manic and surreal coverage of Irene" and "Even as all the storm measurements for Irene show that it will likely be a minor nuisance, maybe some flooding and power outages, multiple states of emergency have been declared, mandatory mass evacuations ordered, and the media is all too eager to spread the panic.  You'd think the east coast of the United States was being invaded.  It feels like a distraction, or perhaps a large but manageable live drill of some kind..."  I have friends and family on the east coast so  watched TWC intently to know how Irene was affecting them. I couldn't believe the hype! Were they looking for ratings or what?And maybe you or your readers can answer this question... have we ever declared a state of emergency BEFORE and event? Seemed kinda odd to me!And here's a video I received a few days ago...thought you might find it interesting. I have friends who live 30 miles from the epicenter of the VA quake who heard a loud BOOM before their house began swaying. They said it lasted almost 5 minutes!! Curious, eh? I have another friend living just north of Trinidad, CO who experienced the quake? there....http://www.disclose.tv/action/viewvideo/77486/Virginia__amp__Colorado_NUKED_UNDERGROUND_/

The 2004 Tsunami was also caused by an earthquake devoid of 'P'-waves and was suspected by Joe Vialls to have been created by a nuclear device detonated in the Sumatra trench. Vialls died of a 'heart attack' soon after releasing his version of events. His original site has moved but a few archived and interesting links are available here... http://www.whale.to/b/vialls_h.htmlDon't worry about Victor, who ascribes himself as one of 'Them', one fine day he will wake up and find out he's been a doormat...Merry wanderings down the rabbit hole...Only Slave's do not Question!Stephen

It's easy to dream up reasons for anything.  It's a lot more difficult to really analyze something.  What I see is no real analysis and tons of dreamed up reasons.  First, there ARE P and S waves with ANY earthquake and ANY large underground detonation.  The source matters not, it's a measue of how the earth responds to the source. Second, if you want to believe they are setting off nukes under Washintgton, go for it.  Whatever conspiracy theory flips your wig. What we have here is just an unusual earthquake in a location that does not have a lot of earthquakes. It happens.  Get over it.  It's part of narture.  My advice, for all those morer willing to believe in fantastic takes rather than simple geology: go back to school and get an education.  Most of what happens around you is "normal" rather than "fantastic".  Just because it isn't on CNN or you haven't seen it first person doesn't make it unnatural.

I've been more worried about the Fukushima earthquake.  The video of a newsroom during the quake show people holding on to desks, etc. but riding it out fairly easily.  That doesn't look like a 9.0 quake, they should be flying across the room with the desks and everything not nailed down!  Then a tidal wave comes in, but the people haven't moved uphill, in the country that invented the word tsunami!  This indicates to me that no wave was expected.  So what causes a tidal wave with no big quake?  Maybe a nuke in the Japan trench?  Throw in the Stuxnet virus which was reported in Japan months before the quake and the whole Fukushima thing starts to look like an act of war.  What ever happened to the two Israeli subs that transited the Suez a while back?

Here is a odd occurance-- My little weather station receves a signal from the atomic clock in cyanne mountian- or boulder Co. the day of these quakes my time clock could not capture any signal at all. dead battries? no-1.50 volis per cell- caused by a solar event? no. solarcycle 24.com confirmed this- the sun was quiet. In fact, the ham bands were quiet also- noise- you see? - I did not know about the quakes until the next morning- oh- approx midnight the weather stations recever aquired it signal fron Colorado- and reset its self- odd timing -you agree?

Well, there is a card game called Illuminati New Worlg Order by Steve Jackson Games. Original game released in the 80s, the second in 95. There is a card called "F-kyoushima" talking about how a telsa nuke causes eathquake/sunami causing radioactive volcano spewing for centuries. It talks about GE nuclear plant. Come to find out GE did build that one faulty core and were helping in the rebuild. Anyway, interesting one for predictions. A card game predicted what was going to happen. Sure, know it sounds far fetched, but if you see the card its creepy!

There's so much bad information in this post. Just the first two points alone are so insanely off-base you can't take the rest of this guy seriously.Location: The quake occurred in one of two seismically active regions in VA. Earthquakes have been recorded near the epicenter since the 1800s.Depth: The quake was at a depth of 3.7 miles, not 528 feet as the author states.

I happened to be on the phone with somebody in Cleveland when the earthquake hit, so I immediately went over to the USGS website to check the status.  I distinctly remember it reporting a shallow depth for at least an hour after the quake hit.  I even remarked on that to a coworker, who also recalls the initial shallow depth.  Of course, USGS can update and change the depth any way they want, whether it's factual or not.  I find it odd that they started out placing it at the first depth and then changed it.Also, the earthquake that happened the night before near Trinidad, CO (also 37 degrees N latitude, same as the VA quake) was fairly shallow and nearly the same magnitude.  I suspect they are related and would love to see research on it as it may give up more clues about the VA quake.

Eric, I thought perhaps I was becoming paranoid with all the unusual happenings around the globe but I, too, thought there was something odd about the VA quake.  Were you aware there was a small NY quake prior to the VA quake?  From Aug.22-28 there were 16 NY quakes in Altamont and Brushron NY.  The largest was a 3.4 in Brushton.  Since Irene ended there has not been a NY quake.  Call me crazy but I feel Irene was a diversion to cover up something else that was going on.  I have read the USGS Quake Reports nearly every day for several years and I have never seen a series of NY quakes posted & I am certain these were not aftershocks related to the VA quake.

It has only been during the past few decadesthat we in Oregon have come to understandhow  susceptible we are to periodic enormousearthquakes. None of us alive have ever experienced one, but they are clearly becoming evident now in thegeologic record as it becomes deciphered. In many communities in Oregon theschools are being torn down and replaced withstructures designed to withstand better the inevitiblemega-quake. Older brick structures built inthe 19th and 20th centuries will probably benothing but rubble after the quake. We alsoface an extreme flooding danger in the Willamette Valleysince we have very large dams in the Cascade Rangefoothills that were built in the mid 20thcentury before the mega-quake threat had fully come to light. Before that, most Oregonians thought that the harmlesslittle shakers  every 15 years or so were the norm. They are in terms of a single human lifetime, but nowwe know that about every 300 years all hell breaks looseand the clock is ticking down to the next major event.

Kia ora"The location is the most obvious anomaly for such a powerful quake......it is considered a relatively dormant or settled area.  In other words, it's not a very active earthquake zone."This scenario means nothing. The Ch-ch Quake in Nz was similar, in fact occuring on previously  unknown faults."I've never "felt" an earthquake whose epicenter was farther than 50 miles away.  Of course, this doesn't mean that it's not possible,"A major quake in 67?, the Inangahua one (Nz), was felt by me tho the epicentre was over 100 miles away. Likewise the Ch-ch quakes in Sept 2010- Feb 2011 were readily felt where I currently live, some 100-130 miles away, registring at an aproximate 3.5-4 magnitude and recorded here some 2 minutes after the initial shock. A Fiordland quake, within the past 5 yrs and which shifted that particular area some 18" closer to Australia, was felt here, a distance of 200+ miles. This not an uncommon experience.

the VA quake occurred almost 12 hours after a similar quake in CO, at about the same latitude.  from what I have heard, the CO and VA quakes are both HAARP origin.  There was also a very distinct HAARP ring near Raleigh preceding the hurricane.  that is all the info I was able to get out of my source...nothing more.  sorry

I follow the Induction Magnetometer daily and look for specific signals usually around 2.5hz range, mostly just to see if quakes do occur at this frequency. To my surprise, prior to the DC and Colorado quakes there were signals at .5hz intervals- .5hz, 1hz, 1.5hz, 2hz and so on. I have never seen this activity before. Here is a chart of the day these signals started. http://maestro.haarp.alaska.edu/cgi-bin/scmag/disp-scmag.cgi?date=20110822&Bx=onThe day Japan had its 9.0 EQ, a very large 2.5hz signal is seen prior to the release of seismic energy. This chart is of the 11th of March. The signal can be seen here as it ends around the time of the EQ, which initially started on the 8th.  http://maestro.haarp.alaska.edu/cgi-bin/scmag/disp-scmag.cgi?date=20110311&Bx=on

Did anybody even notice the fracking story from another news site? Supposedly there is some goin on 160 miles away from the epicenter in WV. Very likely that there is a leak in the pipes somewhere, which would explain the quick dismissal after several 'Nuclear energy is green energy' statements by Obama and various ilk. Sure, it's green, but it ain't safe!Isn't it possible that HAARP and fracking can be combined to produce more results if desired?

Elenin is coming folks... and it is scheduled to bring unparalleled destruction to the midwest on or near 9-11-11. The resulting mega-quake could literally tear the country in half, from Chicago to New Orleans. The military must be using nukes to seal either end of their main tunnel which straddles the New Madrid fault, as it will no longer be usable, and they want the existence of these tunnels to remain secret.

come on america dont you get it yet,your government has declared war on you,katrina,the virginia earthquake was triggered by the HAARP ANTENNA,in alaska,the oil spill in the gulf fukeshima are all deliberate so are the chemtrails that are poisoning the air monsanto is poisoning all the farmland all over the world and now your government is allowing all pristine farmland to be fracked yes and the other F word too,and now they are raiding all the farms that are growing natural health foods,so now what all of you must do is to get together and form your own police force and army and fight back because your existing ones are no longer public servants they serve another agenda,so that means that they have now become your enemy.if you are going to do something you have to do it soon before it is too late.

Firstly, great article.  You do mention you are not a scientist and that these observations seem strange to you, and others you have asked.  It therefore surprises me that so called "smart people" are telling you that your information is incorrect.  How can they determine your observations being incorrect, where they with you or are they just like the majority "sheep" who do what they are told.  Victor in particular.  Clearly his rants make him seem like a wise and knowlegable person.My question is, why do many people assume nukes?  If they are and have developed so many advanced weaponry/technology we do not yet know about - could it be something else explosive?  Is there a way to find tunnels using sonar?  It would be great to find these and map them out.  There are too many strange things going on and many more lies that make me wonder what the hell is really happening.

It seems to me the answer is in the article itself. If someone commits a crime who benefits? irene was projected to be a monster storm and according to the author was then suspiciously sent off course. Perhaps in the beginning the media and government noise around the storm was not hype because whatever action to be taken was not a sure thing. But since it worked, well better safe than sorry.

Some comments on the introduction:“After all, no one has ever felt or even heard of such a powerful temblor happening in this area in a lifetime.”--The previous largest Virginia EQ was a 5.9 in 1897 and was, indeed, over lifetime ago...for humans. ~115 years is, however, not particularly geologically significant. “By no means does this make me an expert, nor scientifically qualified to analyze earthquakes.” --For an analysis by someone who is scientifically qualified to analyze earthquakes, go to the Mountain Beltway blog, starting with this post on the EQ: http://blogs.agu.org/mountainbeltway/2011/08/23/the-mineral-va-earthquake-of-august-23-2011/And one on aftershocks, and the potential for these all being foreshocks (maybe, not necessarily): http://blogs.agu.org/mountainbeltway/2011/08/25/aftershocks/Then read some of the more recent, updated posts on the subject.“I can categorically state that, of the dozen or so earthquakes that I've experienced, including a powerful 6.2, all of them started gently, none of them were over 50 miles away, all of them had depths of several kilometers, and the big ones seemed to have multiple aftershocks reported.”--The Mineral, VA EQ hypocenter was 6km, multiple aftershocks have been reported.“…but Hurricane Irene has all but wiped the earthquake off the weather map.  Even as all the storm measurements for Irene show that it will likely be a minor nuisance, maybe some flooding and power outages…”--Irene caused tens of millions in damages, destroyed thousands of homes, cut off power to 2.5 million people in thirteen states, and flooding continues to develop. We are fortunate that it was only a “minor nuisance”“…one must ponder if some sort of manipulation was involved.  The establishment will not permit such talk, apparently; hence the rapid about-face on earthquake coverage.”--I don’t recall any EQ-related deaths, and so far have only heard reports of some infrastructure damage (e.g. http://blogs.agu.org/mountainbeltway/2011/08/28/damage-to-the-ecuadorian-embassy/ ). I think Irene warrants the more extensive coverage.

Benjamin Fulford was on Noory radio show/youtube a few days ago and mentioned that he received info from 3 sources that this was an underground nuclear explosion destroying 2 underground bases in DC and CO. It was to destroy hiding places for the controllers/elite to hide when/if disaster strikes. Info has not been confirmed.

Thanks poikiloblastic for what is otherwise a thankless task...Of the many incorrect things in the original post, I'd like to comment on the "Odd Seismograph Reading". First of all, explosions (nuclear or otherwise) do produce P-waves, in fact, nearly all their energy goes into P-waves. The main difference is that explosions generate almost no *surface waves*.  Earthquakes usually generate strong surface waves.Second, your seismograph example doesn't tell very much, it's a snapshot from a news article showing a paper drum record. Take a look at a real seismograph further from the source, and you see P-waves, S-waves, and, especially, surface waves: a perfectly normal earthquake record.  See for, example, this record from Central Park in New York City:http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/files/uploaded/image/CentralParkSeis.jpg

Before the quake hit I felt a very distinct wave of energy, almost like a vibration off of a tuning fork.  It was accompanied by a slight feeling of vertigo or weightlessness. I have heard from two other people on the east coast who had a similar sensation. Natural phenomena or haarp I don't know.

The evidence indicates a duel test: a nuclear underground detonation and an airborne EMP test. The EMP test (which damaged two remote controls in my apartment building and a battery-operated clock in my apartment--the clock stopped at exactly 1:53 PM, and the battery was totally drained. The drained battery was also still secure in the battery chamber before I removed it, so it wasn't a loose connection. As a matter of fact, I had to pry the dead battery out with my fingers. Anyway, a battery just doesn't totally drain before showing signs of low life, and my clock was running on time--maybe a minute or two fast--before the 'earthquake') would not result from an underground nuclear detonation. EMP from such a source can travel a few kilometers at best. So the EMP surge came from another source.Unless, of course, if HAARP can cause earthquakesthen one stone kills two birds, but wouldn't HAARP's earthquake generating capabilities be laser-like? So how did the electronics in my apartment house (I live in Washington, DC) go down if it was HAARP causing an earthquake in Mineral, Virginia?Maybe the HAARP test was laser-like for Mineral, Virginia (causing the earthquake), but spread out for the EMP test that affected electronics in Washington, DC?A reply to Anonymous (August 31, 2011 8:54 AM):"Because underground explosions are spherically symmetric disturbances, they radiate seismic P waves efficiently. In contrast, earthquakes result from sliding or rupture along a buried fault surface and strongly excite the transverse motions of S waves. Thus, we expect that explosions will show strong P waves and weak S waves and that earthquakes will show weak P waves and strong S waves."https://www.llnl.gov/str/Walter.htmlContrary to what Press Core wrote (nobody is perfect!), underground detonations are associated with both P waves (which is what you felt before the S waves hit) and S waves.

Interesting theories proposed here...some comments: 1) not uncommon for east coast earthquakes to be felt hundreds of miles--unlike the west coast, quakes on the granite bedrock of the east coast reverberate over a vast area (think hitting sand with a hammer [west coast] and hitting a rock with a hammer [east coast]2) I live 80 miles NW of the epicenter, and felt a distinct vibration for the first seconds and immediately my house began a strong rattling.  It was over within 30 seconds.  This being my first quake experience, I can't say if this is the normal pattern for an east coast quake.  3) It's not uncommon for USGS to modify quake data after the fact, whether the intensity or depth, etc. 4) There have been many aftershocks from this earthquake--go here to see them listed (Virginia): http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/dyfi/And as much as I love a good conspiracy theory, to imply that this was actually an underground nuke explosion is tough to swallow.

Everybody keeps coming up with a nuclear explosion, but keep overlooking a thermobaric explosion...this makes more sense. This is a very effective underground explosion, especially used in caves (Afghanistan) and to take out all kinds of fortified buildings. This also would not leave any nuclear signature or danger for any constrution workers underground. Some Thermobarics (TBX) are the closest thing to a nuclear explosion and still be considered conventional weapons. A google search will quickly bring up video of the Russian "Daddy of all bombs" a TBX and video of all type of homemade TBX with incredible punch for such small devices.

There was a stronger quake on the east coast a hundred years ago.  So, it's just this particular quake that is suspicious.  I believe in corrupt media as much as anyone else, but none of these arguments are selling me.  I'd be just as apt to believe a different scenario where non-existent sun spots are leading to a global cool off similar to the Maunder minimum several hundred years ago.  The sun is like a microwave oven and the earth is like a bag of Orville Redenbachers popcorn in this scenario. This could be easily thermodynamic.  Earthquakes expend a ton of energy.  For a man made source to cause that... not buying it.  I think the planet destabilized on the Japan quake and it let loose with energy elsewhere.

Interesting article.  I do have to comment about what's been said about Hurricane Irene.  although she was not a "monster storm" in one sense of the word, she DID leave lots of flooding (my own county in NJ and say, VT) and property damage. I don't know about overhype, but let's not diminish the devastation she caused and the havoc to many victims.

Guys you do not know what the heck you are talking about. Hurricane Irene had a millibar pressure of a CAT 3 storm but was so large that its base windspeeds were lower. however its gusts were incredible. Lots of record damage and flooding. I live in one of the 7 disaster NC counties. Never seen anything like this the last 15 years I have lived here. Check out the haarp web monitor, it was OFF the scale with lots of odd activity and red/ high intensity on certain freqs. Look it up. Learn something. I do believe haarp was involved but why the earthquake remains a mystery, maybe the bounced the energy the wrong place.

First of all the earthquake occurred in a known seismically active zone. Just because that isn't common knowledge doesn't make the earthquake weird. Second shallow earthquakes happen every day all around the world. Third, if a bomb detonated underground wouldn't change how far seismic waves travel through the earth, that is designated by the material those waves travel through, no fixing that. Fourth, the closer the seismic station is to the epicenter the closer the P- and S-waves hit in time. AKA a quick giant spike in the seismograph. The farther away you are from the epicenter the farther apart the P- and S-waves arrive, hence the 'normal' gradual increase in the seismograph. As far as an 'earthquake' or bomb affecting the weather 500+ miles away.. come on...Now with all that being said, clearly I don't buy any of this 'evidence', however I wouldn't put it past the US government.

Look at the screenshot I´ve made on the day of the Virginia earthquakes, besides one little quake in Japan there was no quake anywhere in the rest of the world.http://i53.tinypic.com/2z68gaf.pngNow look on the strange geometric pattern of the earthquakes, since nature doesn´t use straight lines, this is a clear evidence for Haarp !http://i51.tinypic.com/vio5zp.png

I think the article may have gotten it backwards. P waves are compression waves of the kind that a nuke would propagate. S waves are shear waves of the kind a guitar string experiences. A good way to picture them is to imagine two people holding either end of a slinky toy. If one person hits the back of his hand that is holding the slinky, he creates a compression wave (P wave) that moves toward the other person. If he moves the hand holding the slinky up or down, he creates a shear wave (S wave) that moves toward the other person. In earthquakes, P waves are caused by impacts (just as the striking of the back of the hand holding the slinky). S waves are caused by relative motion between plates. Eric, do your homework. Read about the Asian Tsunami.http://www.thetruthseeker.co.uk/?p=2757

Your efforts are appreciated, Thank You for putting forth your thoughts on the matter. The name callers and hecklers are to be expected, they keep things interesting. Send them love!!!A variety of things flashed through my mind also, and I have not come to any conclusion as of yet. HAARP was my first thought, then explosion etc. Maybe it's a combination of things, we have not given THAT any thought. The quake did not feel right to me either. I kept waiting for it to get stronger, but it just died out in an odd way. There have been quakes in several states - Lat 36-38 degree Tues and Wed. If not odd, it's quite interesting to say the least. Most of the states have experienced low grade tremors between 1-3 sometime during late 2010 and all of 2011. Something is certainly going on, but we may never know the whole truth.I thought it V-E-R-Y interesting that in the NBC show 'The Event', the earthquake caused by the aliens was at 38 deg Latitude. m m m m m m!!!! Interesting coincidence!!!! I also thought it interesting AND odd, about the hurricane coming on the heels of this quake. It all felt 'made up'. I kept saying it's all a 'dry run'[pun intended], and it was likened to a rehearsal for something bigger on the horizon. If people can't read those obvious signs, no amount of proof will convince them. Some things can't be explained, let alone be proved...sometimes we just have to go on raw gut feelings and intuition.Another odd thing after the quake, was that only land lines work, cell phones went dead. They claim overloaded circuits. RIGHT!!! That made as much sense as pigs flying! I continued my working at the computer, and later notice the computer time was off by 4hrs.In the days that followed, there was a sense of being 'out of synch', 'off centered'. Each day felt like a different day...it was weird. To say there was an awareness of 'missing time' would not be a misquote.I notice many people have experiences of 'missing time' lately, and think they are just forgetting or misplacing things. Clocks and watches seem to periodically turn up off by 4hrs. Not sure what's with the '4hr' window, but it's a re-occurring event...especially in October when we change the clocks back. I think a whole lot more than just an hour gets turned back. Talk about a window of opportunity!!!Welcome to The Outer Limits, Twilight Zone and The Dark Side, all rolled into one!!!Any takers on this?
