All About the Power


Posted:  Fri, 02 Sep 2011 13:52:00 +0000
This really makes me wonder.  I keep hearing that the power is going off, but that "they" don't want you to know that it was them that did it.  And that in order to do that, they need to raise the hype and warn you about all the impending disasters that threaten our power so they can cut the grids and blame a disaster.

Like all the hype about the solar peak this year and next.  Be afraid, it threatens your power.

And I'm absolutely convinced that they were tooling around with weather modification when Irene came through.  There were some very seriously strange anomalies in the radar systems during that storm.  There was an estimated three million without power.

Good Morning, Friday


Posted:  Fri, 02 Sep 2011 13:24:00 +0000
Merry Meet, Friends ∞

And happy Friday.  Things in the world seem to be quiet lately, or at least there's nothing new goin' down.  That worries me a little.  I'm thinking calm before the storm.

Today I want to kick off by saying, when the shit hits the fan, and there's no more food, head to Norway.

'Doomsday' seed vault opens in Norway - CNN.com

And as I'm sure most of you know, there were two separate m 7.1 earthquakes in Alaska early this morning.  One at 35.5 km and the other at 39 km in depth.  They appear to have had two aftershocks at his point, 4.8 and 4.5, and there's been another small quake further off the coast at a 4.3.None of these quakes were touching land.  They were all in the water.  There's been tsunami warnings issued for the area.See warnings here.

2011 Rough Year So Far


Posted:  Thu, 01 Sep 2011 14:21:00 +0000
This video highlights SOME of the disasters of 2011 so far. It mentions Joplin, but doesn't cover the INSANE tornado season we had this year.

http://www.thorntonweather.com/tornado-stats.php ∞ 544 deaths and what MUST amount to hundreds of millions in damages.

Unfortunately, it also fails to include all the erupting volcanoes, being that there's 40 of them so far, and the massive drought that's killing crops, people, and animals in the western states.

I'm not pointing these things out to rag on the video. I'm pointing them out because this video is exactly what it claims to be. Some. My intent is to mention what's missing from the video, because if you're anything like me, you were a little surprised at how much is shown. Take that surprise, and add to it the realization that there's a LOT missing, too.

It's just incredible the pounding the world has been taking this year.  And we've still got three months to go with hurricane season just getting started. Hell, half the east coast is already under water.

Don't be scared. Be prepared. Get your emergency kits together! Even if you don't believe a disaster will strike YOUR community, everything that's going down everywhere else is going to drive the price of EVERYTHING through the roof. That's why we are capitalists :) {insert douchebags}

Quakes and Lies


Posted:  Thu, 01 Sep 2011 11:47:00 +0000
It strikes me as funny that the USA would measure an earthquake as a 5.9 at 35.4 km deep, which is below the 6.0 region where the red flags go off.

USGS~Santa Cruz Islands Quake

But the exact same quake measured by European seismologists and equipment comes back as a 6.1 at 26 km deep.  Not only AT the red flag mark, but slightly above.  And what's with the nearly 10 km difference?

EMSC~ Santa Cruz Islands Quake

The depth discrepancy is curious also.  USA says weaker and deeper, while the EMSC says stronger and closer to the people.Curiouser and curiouser...

Magnitude 3.1 - OHIO


Posted:  Thu, 01 Sep 2011 11:16:00 +0000
Merry Meet, Friends ∞

This is the first thing I saw this morning when I sat down here with my coffee. We just shook YESTERDAY morning! Another quake again today is so, SO unusual for our area.

It sort of makes me wonder if that big one in VA shook some stuff loose for us. And speaking of, I think I'll just call it the VA cover-up. Be nice if everyone could agree on a magnitude. Still ranked 5.8 by USGS, but noted to be as high as 6.5 in Europe.

Elenin's Voice


Posted:  Thu, 01 Sep 2011 01:30:00 +0000
This is a curious video.  Apparently a radio telescope in California picked up a strange frequency coming from the coordinates of comet Elenin.

I wonder if later they'll translate it to mean, "S.O.S We're breaking up!" LOL

Elenin Breaking Up? I Dunno...


Posted:  Thu, 01 Sep 2011 00:38:00 +0000
Apparently the word of the day is that comet Elenin is breaking up and melting and will no longer pose a threat... not that it posed a threat in the first place.

This guy, however, does NOT agree, and his video is pretty interesting.  And btw, he IS using NASA images from Stereo, so check it out and see what you think.

Okay, Rant Over


Posted:  Tue, 30 Aug 2011 03:08:00 +0000
I just get so frustrated when I keep seeing the same disinformation circulating when I've already taken the time to look into it a moment and try to either prove or disprove it.I mean, I knew this video was bogus the first time I looked at it.When we continually mirror bogus videos and post links to things simply because they scare us, we are doing our entire species a disservice.  We're feeding into the machine and spreading the fear, just like they want us to.THEY WANT YOU TO BE TERRIFIED!!  YOU'RE EASIER TO CONTROL THAT WAY!!So please, before you mirror that youtube video, or post that link to your Facebook page or Twitter or share it with everyone you know, take a moment and just try to prove it.  Try to find someone else who agrees, but doesn't simply have the same video or reference link posted.If something is Truth, more than ONE source will have the scoop on it.....I'm sort of sorry... I'm not sorry for what I said, but I'm sorry I'm such a bitch when I'm angry...Peace.

Fuck Your CNN Report


Posted:  Tue, 30 Aug 2011 02:17:00 +0000
If I see this video referenced again, I just may scream and have to hurt someone!  I am so pissed about this bullshit!!

I joined some groups that are supposedly about seeking the truth, and shoveling through the disinformation, but everyone keeps constantly reposting the stupid article about the FAKE nuclear detonations that DIDN'T cause the Virginia earthquake, and this chopped, edited CNN video about Nibiru!

http://youtu.be/2ZoMG0EOJRI



Get a fucking GRIP you ignorant sheeple and stop spreading all this BULLSHIT!  Contribute to the truth or shut the fuck up and just sit quietly in your illusions.You can even TELL that this report is bullshit. If it wasn't, why the FUCK would a news reporter, reporting the possible end of the world, begin the report with, "And the winner is...".. ?  I mean, seriously? Are you all really THAT Goddamned ignorant?!FUCK!

A Thought on Movies


Posted:  Tue, 30 Aug 2011 00:10:00 +0000
There's an awful lot of hype around the similarities between our current circumstances in this world, and some fairly recent end of the world type movies.I've even heard it suggested that it's actually our conscious focus upon such movies that is creating our current situation.http://youtu.be/4M9Tzvgnzkk



The most common theory is that the Illuminati have been basically taunting us with the information for decades.I had a thought strike me today, and it really made me wonder.  What if it was a psychic vision had by the writer of the script?Any artist will tell you that in order to create, you're really in "the zone" with a clear mind and the vision just flows.  Wouldn't writing a movie be the same thing?It's funny that Armageddon and Deep Impact both came out at practically the same time.  Two slightly different visions of the same, basic event.I guess all I'm saying is... I've had some pretty major epiphanies and ideas when I was in a state of quiet meditation.  Isn't it at least possible that maybe these movies were "channeled" from the same conscious space?

A Mercury & Aluminum High

Merry Meet, Friends ∞

I've got vaccinations on the brain today.  I sure hope none of you plan to run right out and get your THREE injections of flu vaccine that our wise president is URGING you to get this year.

That's just insanity.  All the mercury and aluminum and host of other toxic chemicals.

I get that they're doing it for money, but what I don't get is who they think they're gonna make money off of after their "medicine" kills everybody....

Want to know the truth about your vaccines?  Check this out...

http://youtu.be/WwqnNQuUb8k



Secret vaccine industry ties and military involvement with Institute of Medicine.Want to see the official report that states how dangerous vaccines are? The report FROM the Institute of Medicine, that was later twisted a bit so as to convince the public of their safety?Look HERE.
***
Institute of Medicine adverse reactions report admits MMR vaccines cause measles, seizures, anaphylaxis and other health problems***
It has now been widely revealed that the United States conducted medical  experiments on prisoners and mental health patients in Guatemala in the  1940's.***
And they even get regular people to pose as knowledgeable doctors and write bullshit articles to convince you that you NEED their drugs...

It's really quite mind boggling to think that the people who are supposed to have all of our best interests in mind are openly lying to us and slowly convincing us to allow them to poison us.

Please, for the love of Pete, don't vaccinate your kids and stay WAY away from those damn flu shots!

The Mayan Calendar


Posted:  Sun, 28 Aug 2011 17:55:00 +0000
Merry Meet, Friends ∞

Dutchsinse posted a blog this morning about the Mayan calendar that I rather enjoyed.   You can read it here.

Anyway, this video is part of the post, and I also enjoyed it very much.

http://youtu.be/XEAYmbaYUf0



With the amount and strength of the quakes we've been having, I don't find it hard to believe that it's all going to hit the fan with a giant quake.

And that got me thinking...

Yunno where I wouldn't wanna be if the earth is nearly shook apart?   Underground.   Underground where all the elite are apparently abandoning their posts, and going to hide.

Sorta seems like that certainly WOULD bring our civilization into a new cycle.   All the "high ups" would be terminated, and the ones that would be left would be those who knew what was coming, and prepared.

Then there would be a new world order of a kind no one expected.

And just for the record, I am personally a believer in the October 28, 2011 date found here.



I've also heard it said that "maya" means illusion and if a calendar records time, then the end of the "Mayan Calendar" is the end of the illusions of time. I like that.I also sort of wonder if the 12-21-12 date was constructed because of it's symmetry and fed to us so we WOULD be unprepared, NOW.   Like, why worry in August of 2011?   Nothing big will happen for another YEAR at least...▲▼▲▼▲▼▲▼▲▼▲Keep seeking Truth,

Disturbances in My Neighborhood


Posted:  Fri, 26 Aug 2011 20:17:00 +0000
I witnessed three things that disturbed me in the twenty minutes I was gone, running down to the local Mom & Pop, and home again.#1) Ground beef is up by an entire dollar per pound.I was picking up some hamburger for dinner.  I took the hint and bought a few.  I don't think it's going to be going down anytime soon.  Rather, through the ceiling, if it doesn't cease being available altogether.
#2) Our little town is well known around the county for being the cheapest gas around.  It's up thirty five cents per gallon since YESTERDAY!  From $3.40 to today's $3.75.I found one station that was in the process of changing their price from $3.59 to $3.75, and managed to swoop in (thank you angels) and get my tank topped off before the price jumped.
I've been keeping my tank above three quarters of a tank lately.  Seemed like a smart idea.
#3) There was a fleet of probably twenty power company trucks parked around the truck-stop near my home.  They only do that when they know the shit is gonna hit the fan.I know hurricane Irene is supposed to be one hell of a storm.  I wonder if power companies from surrounding states are driving into the storm to help with clean-up?If you don't have your shit together, East Coasters, get it together!  In a disaster camp is NOT where you want to end up, so don't be unprepared!  I don't know how deep these observations go, but Irene is front and center right now.  One disaster at a time, please!

More Confirmed Insanity & Disinformation Exposed

Oil continues to leak in the Gulf of Mexico.

More fear porn exposed!!http://youtu.be/9_0Gj0IXwaw


In the comment field on his video page, I asked him to prove there was a leak and that the picture was real.  He told me I could see for myself using Elenin's coordinates and looking on Google sky.I went to the JPL site and pulled up Elenin's coordinates for today, Friday August 26, 2011, and went to look.  There is NOTHING even remotely close to what this guy is presenting as "leaked pictures of Elenin."When I returned and asked him to show me, and gave him today's coordinates, he disabled the comments for the video.Here's a screen shot of my facebook account where youtube posts my comments automatically.

Here's a few pieces of government insanity currently taking place for all to see.  These are not conspiracy theories, people!  These are happening in YOUR communities!

WAKE UP!!!

Children vaccinated at gun point in Maryland. Even if it IS from 2007.

And...

How does using nuisance abatement teams to force Antelope Valley residents to destroy their houses and vacate their properties is in the public interest? LA county California


And...Hospital patients are now being microchipped.  Oh yeah.  Hello Bible prophecies.
And...There are currently 40 volcanoes erupting.  Why is no one talking about this?!
