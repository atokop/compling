Animals at zoos across the East Coast showed signs of distress up to 15 minutes before the huge earthquake struck, leaving $100m worth of damage.Keepers at the National Zoo in Washington DC say that red-ruffed lemurs started barking an alarm call a quarter of an hour before Richter scales leapt at 1.51pm yesterday.And about three seconds before the ground started to shake, the zoo's gorilla Mandara gave a yell, gathered up her baby, Kibibi, and then climbed a tree.Zookeepers said Iris the Orangutan started 'belch vocalising' before the earthquake started, and did not stop until it was over, while a 64-strong flock of flamingos huddled together ahead of humans noticing anything was wrong.Scroll down for video

Apology; For fear of collapse, the Washington Monument has been closed to the public
A pride of lions had the foresight to walk to away from the shelter in advance of the quake hitting.
Elsewhere, at the National Aquarium 
in Baltimore, the dolphins - in the midst of a training session - began 
to swim away from their trainers, paired up and began swimming rapidly 
around the tank about 10 seconds before the seismic waves began.

And closer to the epicentre, the Richmond Zoo in Virgina says the chimps began 'acting up and hollering' before the quake began.
'Animals we know from experimental 
studies, can hear above and below our range of hearing, that's part of 
their extra-sensory abilities,' said Don Moore, associate director of 
animal care at the National Zoo. 

'They are responding to danger,' said
Brandie Smith from the National Zoo. 'So when there is danger present, a
lot of animals go to the place where they are safest from danger.'

The remarkable reports surfaced as it emerged that the earthquake has devastated historic buildings, causing a huge $100million in damage.
Terrifying tremors were felt 
throughout the north east causing buildings from Washington D.C. through New York City to Toronto, Canada, to be evacuated yesterday for fear of collapse. The 5.8 magnitude earthquake, which originated
in Virginia, brought panic to the Pentagon and the White House, and sparked fears that the iconic Washington Monument would fall.The
huge structure, which was said to have tilted because of the shudder, 
cracked because of the earthquake and has since been closed indefinitely
to the public for immediate repairs.

Overall damage caused across the coast was estimated to be a huge $100million.In Mineral, Virginia - the epicentre 
of the earthquake - people's homes were trashed and supermarkets looked 
as if they had been ransacked by looters.

 As ripples from the tremor hit 
Washington and New York, city streets across the coast were filled with 
thousands of people hauled out of buildings for fear they could 
collapse.
There were also fears of a nuclear 
disaster of the kind seen in Japan's Fukushima because the epicentre was
just ten miles from a nuclear power plant.
Federal officials said two nuclear 
reactors at the North Anna Power Station in Louisa County, Virginia, 
were automatically taken off line by safety systems.At the Pentagon, it was reported that staff ran from the building fearing they were under attack.As authorities revealed that aftershocks from the earthquake could last for weeks, it emerged the Washington Monument will be closed 
indefinitely to the public after engineers found cracks in the building.
The monument suffered minor damage but cracks were found in the stones at the top of the structure, sparking fears of collapse.

A police officer had earlier insisted he had seen the monument tilting because of the vibrations.A
family who were at the top of the monument when the quake hit said they
felt it swap almost a foot, while pieces of the structure fell on top 
of them.At the National Cathedral in Washington D.C. three of the four pinnacles of the tower were damaged.Engineers are currently working to try to limit the damage.The 5.8-magnitude tremor struck at about 2pm local time with shallow tremors of about 3.7 miles deep, which is thought to explain why the shaking was so widespread.
The
U.S. Geological Survey said the earthquake was half a mile deep and 
centred near Louisa, Virginia, about 40 miles north west of Richmond. 
It is though to have been the strongest quake to hit the Virginia area for seven decades.
The previous record for an earthquake in the Washington, D.C. area was on July 16, 2010, when a 3.6 magnitude one struck.

'This
is one of the largest earthquakes on the east coast in quite a while, 
in many decades at least,' USGS spokeswoman Lucy Jones told CNN.Tremors were also felt as far north as New York City and Martha's Vineyard, where President Obama is vacationing.

any structural damage at this time,' a spokesman for the New York City 
Fire Department said.Buildings in Boston were evacuated, while witnesses said the quake was felt as far away as Toronto.  

Impact: The earthquake could be felt across the East Coast of AmericaIn New York, many office buildings 
were evacuated.Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly was in the NYPD's 14th floor executive command centre planning a 9-11 memorial service.'We felt a rumbling and the floor shaking underneath,' said his spokesman, Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne.Mary Lupoli, 64, a supervisor in the NYPD's public inquiry office at 1 Police Plaza, said she thought the worst when the evacuation order came.'I kind of thought it could be a terrorist attack. It's THAT time,' she said.The 26-story federal courthouse in lower Manhattan began swaying and hundreds of people fled into the street.When Ellen Rea felt the tremors in her New York she panicked and thought of 10 years ago.'I’m not a person who gets scared, but I thought of 9/11 and thought what the hell happened?” she told CNNShe remembered being near the World Trade Center nearly 10 years ago and coming home with the ashes in her hair.'It actually surprised me how those thoughts came up,' she said.  'I’m a tough New Yorker. I was really surprised that was the first thought.'Charlene Lloyd, 25, who works on the 60th floor of the Empire State 
Building, told the New York Daily News: 'It felt like I was in a boat. I was on the phone with a client, and I hung up and ran.'Bill Parks, from Hummelstown, added: 'Our townhouse started shaking a short time ago and 
branches started to fall off trees and hit our windows and hit our roof 
like crazy.'

'It lasted about 10 seconds and was as
bad as the Northridge after shock I had experienced while visiting in 
California. I ran outdoors and found my neighbour calling a friend in 
Virginia who also felt the profound quake. This quake was like none I 
ever experienced in the East in my life and I am 76 years old.'The city said calls to 911 spiked to 6,900 in the half hour between 1.30 pm and 2.00pm, most placed in the final 10 minutes. Normally, 911 receives 800 calls in a half hour.Thomas
McGarry, 55, has run a small convenience store kiosk above subway 
tracks right in front of New York city hall for the last year and a 
half. 

He told MailOnline he was in the kiosk when the quake hit. 'We all looked at each other. I thought the floor was going to cave in,' he said.

Gross, also 55, was working on the fourth floor of a federal office 
building on church street, just down the street from ground zero, when 
she felt the tremors.

'We thought it was construction,' she said. 'But then my daughter called from uptown and said: 'Mummy we just had an earthquake.' Her husband, who works as a maintenance worker uptown, told her he was on a ladder when the quake hit. 'He thought his legs were giving out before realising the whole building was shaking,' she said.When Alex Priest, a director of a marketing company, felt the tremors on his 7th
floor office in Bethesda, Maryland, he suspected a 
terrorist attack. He told CNN he and his co-workers sprinted out of the building.
'I was young when the attacks happened,' said Mr Priest, 22, about 
9/11.  'For the vast majority of my formative years, we’ve just had this
national security mindset. There are terrorists out there.'
'Just being in that environment and having that as a constant issue 
in the news and because of the 9/11 anniversary, the first thing that 
comes into your mind any time something bad happens is "Oh my God, is it 
terrorist attack?"'

monitors rocking slightly,' he told the Charlotte Observer.Another resident told the newspaper that dishes and plates in his house shook. 

Control towers at John F. Kennedy and Newark Liberty International airports were also evacuated.

Andre Smith-Pugh, 25, felt the shaking from the top of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building.'It felt like the scaffolding was 
coming down,' he told the New York Times. 'It felt like a big truck 
slammed into the side of the building right here at the White House.'
In Mineral, Virginia, which is four 
miles from the quake’s centre, residents said there had been extensive 
damage, with pictures falling off walls and crockery smashing from 
shelves.

It felt like a B-52 unloading.’Not everyone, however, was quite so terrified by the tremors. On Wall Street traders could be heard shouting: 'Carry on
trading!' despite the shaking.Watch the video

"Strange this earthquake report, as my friend in Virginia e-mailed me and said he didn't feel a thing. Neither did my another friend feel anything in Wellington while having a pint outside the English pub there.. Did this earthquake really happen or was it just a slow news day?" - albert hall, hove england, 24/8/2011 22:29....................I'm no expert but being outside may have something to do with it. When a much smaller tremor hit last year I was outside walking on my lunch break and felt nothing. When I got to the front door I met a crowd of people on their way out who told me the building was being evacuated after shaking for about 30 seconds. (Simple precaution, so they could check for any damage like broken gas lines etc. No one expected it to collapse into a pile of rubble)

It's not "magic." Most animals have better senses than humans do. The 5 senses that humans have is strong, but still weak compared to most animals. It's observed in every natural disaster that wild animals are the first ones to run away as fast as they can before the disaster strikes. Unfortunately for the animals in zoo, it must be particularly scary for them because they know but can't really run anywhere.

What I find truly amazing is how some people have used this opportunity to take cheap shots at the Americans. Remember that there has not been an earthquake of this magnitude in 100+ years in an area not known for them, and after 9/11 the first thing to come to mind is terrorism. As far as God punishing America -- get real!

MamaBear, Down at the Shopping Mall, 24/8/2011 20:01........................Surely you mean the Shopping Centre.
Little Corner of Blighty etc. etc. etc.
No, I mean SHOPPING MALL because where I live, that's what we call them. We also have Outlet Malls, Plazas, Box Store Centres. So just because you call it a Shopping Centre, doesn't mean everyone else on the planet does. If that's all you have to do all day is pick up on minor language differences, may I respectfully suggest that you go get yourself a life. 
To Alec in Cornwall - Yes I am aware of it being a sport. Having British relatives & living around the Americans all my life, I regulary take part, make fun of both & find it great entertainment. My point was this - A comments section about an earthquake wasn't the forum for this "sport" as you put it. So stick your lecture pal, because I'm an expert at this particular form of entertainment as I have had many years of honing my skills.

If we, as a race, weren't so obsessed with things that don't matter - beauty, wealth and oneupmanship being just three of them - maybe our senses would be more heightened. On a lighter note - in the pic of the supermarket, it seems there is more on the floor than is missing from the shelves!
