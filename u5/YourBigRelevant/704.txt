Is The Number Of Earthquakes Increasing? Why The 5.8 Virginia Earthquake Might Just Be A Preview Of Things To Come: "Is the number of earthquakes increasing?  Are major earthquakes becoming more frequent?  In the aftermath of the magnitude-5.8 earthquake in Virginia, a whole lot of people are asking those questions.  All over the mainstream media, 'experts' are coming on and assuring the public that all of this is 'normal' and that the number of earthquakes is not actually increasing.  The USGS continues to insist that the frequency of major earthquakes has been 'fairly constant' and that there is no reason for alarm.  But is that really the truth?

The mainstream media is much more interested in keeping people calm than it is in telling them the truth.  Our planet is becoming increasingly unstable, and the magnitude-5.8 Virginia earthquake that we just witnessed might just be a preview of things to come..."
