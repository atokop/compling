Home Video Tsunami earthquake Japan 2011 A devastating tsunami triggered by the biggest earthquake on record in Japan killed at least 1000 people along the northeastern coast on Friday after a wall of water swept away everything in its path. Thousands of residents were evacuated from an area around a nuclear plant north of Tokyo after fears of a radiation leak, but officials said problems with the reactor's cooling system were not at a critical level. Underscoring grave concerns about the plant, the US air force delivered coolant to the facility, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said. The unfolding disaster in the wake of the 8.9 magnitude earthquake and 10-meter (33-feet) high tsunami prompted offers of help from dozens of countries. China said rescuers were ready to help with quake relief while President Barack Obama told Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan the United State would assist in any way. Stunning TV footage showed a muddy torrent of water carrying cars and wrecked homes at high speed across farmland near the coastal city of Sendai, home to one million people and which lies 300 km (180 miles) northeast of Tokyo. Ships had been flung onto a harbor wharf, where they lay helplessly on their side. Japanese politicians pushed for an emergency budget to fund relief efforts after Kan asked them to "save the country" . Japan is already the most heavily indebted major economy in the world, meaning any funding efforts would be closely scrutinized by financial markets <b>...</b>

March 11 (Bloomberg) -- Japan was struck by its strongest earthquake in at least a century, an 8.9-magnitude temblor that shook buildings across Tokyo and unleashed a tsunami as high as 10 meters, engulfing towns along the northern coast. At least 18 people were killed by the 33-foot wave and many are missing, according to state broadcaster NHK Television, which showed footage of waves sweeping away buildings and vehicles as far as 1.5 kilometers inland. Airports were closed down and bullet train services suspended. More than 4 million homes are without power, Tokyo Electric Power Co. said. "Major damage occurred in the Tohoku area" north of Tokyo, Prime Minister Naoto Kan said in a nationally televised address after convening an emergency response team. "I call on citizens to act calmly. Especially those who are near a beach, please evacuate to higher ground to avoid the tsunami." The world's strongest earthquake in more than six years struck at 2:46 pm local time 130 kilometers (81 miles) off the coast of Sendai, north of Tokyo, at a depth of 24 kilometers, the US Geological Survey said. It was followed by a 7.1- magnitude aftershock at 4:25 pm, the agency said. The Philippines, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea were among more than 20 countries bracing for a possible tsunami, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said. The Japanese yen was little changed at 82.76 at 4:54 pm The Nikkei 225 Average fell after the quake and closed 1.7 percent down. Japanese government bonds <b>...</b>

On March 11, 2011, a magnitude 8.9 earthquake rocked the island nation of Japan, one of the strongest earthquakes the world has ever seen. It has been said that due to the earthquakes and tsunami, the entire East coast of Japan has been shifted 8 feet West. The devastation is far-reaching and has affected not only Japan, but so many countries around the globe. As the damage is being accounted for, the death toll has risen to nearly 1000 and is continuing to rise.

More about me at my blog below... www.myonlinebusinessstrategyinfo.org There have been earthquakes today in Hawaii, Alaska and Papua New Guinea. The earthquake in Hawaii was the weakest of them all, coming in at 3.5 on the Richter scale. This quake was really more of a tremor and basically made people nervous that there was more to come. A 6.7 quake was felt today in the Fox Islands. The earthquake did not pose a tsunami threat to the United States West Coast. This is something that is of a concern from time to time when earthquakes strike in coastal regions. The 7.3 earthquake in Papua New Guinea took place within what is dubbed "The Ring of Fire." This area of the world experiences high magnitude earthquakes quite regularly. The Papua New Guinea earthquake initially sparked tsunami fears in Indonesia, but warnings were subsequently lifted when it was realized that a threat was not posed. There has been a lot of seismic activity this year. The reason you hear about it more and more is because people are sensitive after the megaquakes experienced in both Haiti and Chile. So far, we've averted any other major earthquake related disaster. 18.07.2010 - 13 7.2 Indonesian archipelago Papua New Guinea Ismeretlen Kimbe Situation Update No. 1 On 18.07.2010 at 15:58 GMT+2 Two powerful earthquakes struck the island of New Britain in Papua New Guinea on late Sunday evening, seismologists said, briefly sparking a local tsunami warning for Indonesia.
