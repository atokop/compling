 The city hall is is 50-year-old and deteriorating. Rooms are too small, and departments are housed in different private buildings leading to a lower quality of service for the residents. We absolutely must have the new city hall. Our goal is to come up with the base plan by the fiscal 2013. However, the priority should go to the earthquake retrofit of the Special Ward Offices. During the earthquake of March 11, there were some Ward Offices whose service was interrupted because of fallen bookshelves.

"Gov't says 27 US reactors could be more vulnerable to earthquakes than previously thought", according to the article on 9/2/2011.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The risk that an earthquake would cause a severe accident at a U.S. nuclear plant is greater than previously thought, 24 times as high in one case, according to an AP analysis of preliminary government data. The nation's nuclear regulator believes a quarter of America's reactors may need modifications to make them safer.

 The threat came into sharp focus last week, when shaking from the largest earthquake to hit Virginia in 117 years appeared to exceed what the North Anna nuclear power plant northwest of Richmond was built to sustain.

 The two North Anna reactors are among 27 in the eastern and central U.S. that a preliminary Nuclear Regulatory Commission review has said may need upgrades. That's because those plants are more likely to get hit with an earthquake larger than the one their design was based on. Just how many nuclear power plants are more vulnerable won't be determined until all operators recalculate their own seismic risk based on new assessments by geologists, something the agency plans to request later this year. The NRC on Thursday issued a draft of that request for public comment.

 The review, launched well before the East Coast quake and the Japan nuclear disaster in March, marks the first complete update to seismic risk in years for the nation's 104 existing reactors, despite research showing greater hazards.

 The NRC and the industry say reactors are safe as they are, for now. The average risk to U.S. reactors of core damage from a quake remains low, at one accident every 500 years, according to the AP analysis of NRC data.

 The overall risk at a typical reactor among the 27 remains very slight. If the NRC's numbers prove correct, that would mean no more than one core accident from an earthquake in about 30,000 years at the typical reactor among the 27 with increased risk.

I am Japanese, and I not only read Japanese news sources for information on earthquake and the Fukushima Nuke Plant but also watch press conferences via the Internet when I can and summarize my findings, adding my observations.

Well, this was, until March 11, 2011. Now it is taken over by the events in Japan, first earthquake and tsunami but quickly by the nuke reactor accident.

Elenin approaches, Earthquakes increase! Colorado 5.3 US coverup?

An earthquake occurred on April 24, 1758 that affected sections of Washington. âIts probable center was near Annapolis, Maryland, and it was felt into Pennsylvania. An earthquake in March 1828 was felt over a wide area, including seven Eastern States and the District of Columbia. Although no damage occurred, it was reported to be âviolentâ in D.C. and Baltimore, Maryland. John Quincy Adams, then President of the United States, left the following account in his diary of the occurrence as he observed the shock at the White House:âMarch 9, 1828. There was this evening the shock of an earthquake, the first which I ever distinctly noticed at the moment when it happened. I was writing in this book, when the table began to shake under my hand and the floor under my feet. The window shutters rattled as if shaken by the wind, and there was a momentary sensation as of the heaving of a ship on the waves. It continued about two minutes, then ceased. It was about eleven at night. I immediately left writing, and went to my bedchamber, where my wife was in bed, much alarmed.âHere are some dates of earthquakes that impacted the nationâs capital: April 29, 1852, August 1861, September 1884, October 1885, May 1897, February 1925, and November 1935.

The Virginia Earthquake occurred to fulfilled a two fold purpose. Â The first is that is is a wake up call to the East Coast that the Earth is not a planet that is fixed in a solid mass with liquid oceans, lakes and rivers. Â It is something that has movement andÂ strengthÂ to that movementÂ thatÂ is beyond mans capacity to control. Â Overboard mankind hating environmental zealots would like us to believe we are responsible forÂ creatingÂ earthquakes. Â I do not see the evidence that this is true. Â I do see an increase in theÂ occurrencesÂ of earthquakes worldwide.We have seen theÂ greatÂ earthquake in Japan, and earthquakes elsewhere that have unleashed the energy into the waters causing deadly Tsunami waves. Â In Japan there is the lingering destruction of unleashed radioactivity from man-made structures. Â Both the east coast and the west coast of the US now have experienced earthquakes of large proportion. Â We do haveÂ fault-linesÂ and have known of their existence for decades, and longer. Â If we build in a flood plane that has been dry for hundred years, it is still a flood plane. Â If we build on a fault line we risk the end result of an earthquake. Â Volcanoes do come alive again even if they appear dormant. Â We do see the foolishness of building in potentially hazardous locations.This aside, Congress was in recess and POTUS was putting in MV. Â Where they lucky at the timing or was they gone because whoever caused the earthquake wanted to test it when theÂ governmentÂ was not in session. Â Oops, that's a conspiracy theory that I do not believe most people would lend any credence to.The second purpose of the earthquake is to make this nation aware that even the seats of our government could be in jeopardy should an earthquake occur with an angrier attitude.This should be noted that it is a wake up call to this nation as to how far we have strayed from our purpose as endowed upon us by our Creator. Â We kowtow to every idol, every foreign religion, every form ofÂ apostasy,Â everyÂ form of defiance against God, every whim of lust, and we then condemn and hold in contempt those who do serve theÂ TruthÂ and those who standÂ againstÂ the evils of this world.This is One nation under God. Â He could raise up another to take our place. Â How dare we stand againstÂ Him,Â His Word, His Law, and His people.

Fracing done correctly no more causes earthquakes than pumping oil causes volcanoes.Â  the Eco-nuts in this world use petroleum products every day, and then go out and try with their uninformed protests, etc. to kill the very industry they all rely on for transportation, heating, cooling (electricity) etc. go to Â http://www.ranken-energy.com/P...Â  it shows you exactly what you all need fossil fuel for, or at least 144 of the over 6000 uses for it. Either stop using petroleum products completely, (good luck with that!) orÂ be qiuet and find something elseÂ  to rave on about. Everything worthwhile comes at a cost, but this is overkill by eco-freaks. go learn someÂ geology and petroleum engineering before you speak about that which you know nothing about.

This article is beyond description, to put it mildly. The total lack of understanding, education, and thought of what is really involved, not to mention I do not think your understanding of what is involved in fracking, chemically is very good. Wait let me restate that, it is beyond stupid! Stop reading the idiots comments in the Huffington Post, the last time a fact appeared on that site was, well never!!! To think a few million gallons of water is going to cause a several trillion tons of rock to move around 100 miles away, sorry did you buy the bridge for sale too????Do a little math instead of just being aÂ  fool. The "earthquakes" caused by fracking are only detectable by very sensitve equipment, a fault line is ancient beyond belief and it is going to move occasionally, that is way it is a fault line, that is why the continents float over the earth liquid core! The reason the continents have moved over the eons and caused fault lines is because granite is lighter than the magma. The continents are like boats, very large, very heavy boats, with seams!!!!!

Industry scientists are real scientists with real degrees from real technical universities. Â Sorry, skeptics, but they do know what they are talking about. Fracing does not cause earthquakes. Â If the people disposing of the frac water use a well that is drilled into a fault zone, the fluid can lubricate the fault and cause a small quake. Â Frac fluid does not contain toxic chemicals like benzene. Â There are small amounts of chemicals and other materials that you can find in your own home. Â Guar gum, citric acid, potassium chloride, and isopropanol are commonly used: these are in products you use or consume in your home, like deodorant, ice cream, salt substitutes, and beverages. Â Also there is no way that a frac job in West Viriginia would affect a fault zone over 100 miles away. Â I could go on with many more facts, but people who have their minds made up can/t be swayed by facts.

"Industry scientists say" blah blah blah.Â  Puppet goons have been lying to the public ever since they started getting paid.Â  Of course frakking is causing earthquakes.Â  Big "DUH."Â  The energy industry has no problem destroying the planet for money.

Within hours of an earthquake striking the eastern U.S. Tuesday, a rabbi that has spoken for the anti-gay group National Organization for Marriage (NOM) was already blaming homosexuals.

In a video posted to YouTube, Rabbi Yehuda Levin asserted that “one of the reasons God brings earthquakes to the world is because of the transgressions of homosexuality.”

“An email went out in my community just a few hours ago, ‘How long will it take Rabbi Levin to tie this earthquake in with homosexual marriage?’” he began. “Not very long at all. I’m happy to see that people — even if some of them are scoffers — are starting to see the connection.”

“Yes, there is a direct connection between earthquakes and homosexuality. There was in Haiti and it is here, in New York, in Washington, D.C., where they passed homosexual legislation ordinances, in New York City and state, where they opened, especially on Sunday early, where they passed the homosexual marriage law.”

WASPS like this game; I blame the earthquake on the Jews.Â  And Wall Street, and…..

Rabbi Yehuda Levin asserted that âone of the reasons God brings earthquakes to the world is because of the transgressions of homosexuality.â

I blame the earthquake on Iowa. For making Michele Bachmann – theÂ ’pray the gay away’ submission wifeÂ  – as their Straw Poll topper.

“Yes, there is a direct connection between earthquakes and homosexuality.”

Ooh, ooh! I want to believe in his God! His God fucks with straights for letting gays live! His God is manly! His God is straight! His God is hung better than your God! Honestly, if I still smoked dope I would be the first to stone the gays! Really! San Francisco and LA are still standing but they’ll get what’s coming to them! Just you wait! Any decade now! The 6.0 quake in the same region back in 1897 was just a warning to do something about homosexuality! And all those quakes in the middle of the ocean… they were to punish all the gay mackerel! Bad gay fish! And that heat wave and drought in Texas and Oklahoma… that’s God punishing everybody in Texas for electing assholes like Perry and Inhofe, and not smothering Bush in his crib! And those volcanoes in Alaska… well, Sarah Palin can see them from her verandah! Yes, any God who requires his male followers to lob off their foreskins

what is being left unsaid by the rabbi is that earthquakes also cause homosexuality.

anyone who has ever ‘felt’ an earthquake is by definition now gay.

Well that’s just great!Â  I can cause an earthquake but do I get my own parking spot?Â  NO.

Yea, you fucking moron… there were NEVER earthquakes before the U.S. began to (grudgingly) quit discriminating against homahseckshuls.

I’m jumping up and down outside his door so he thinks it’s an earthquake.Â

I think the cause of earthquakes is the hypocriting (sic) of religious people. Â If they would stop hypocriting (sic) all of our problems would be solved.

Although you really do have to wonder, if he thinks DC declaring gay marriage legal only warranted a 5.9 earthquake, what did the God-fearing homophobes across the Middle East–of all races and faiths–do to deserve what’s been happening to them there for, say, the last 3000 years?

Lol.Â  If people could cause earthquakes by being gay, female, non-caucasian, poor, hungry, unemployed, or any other right-wing sin, every city on the planet would have payed for society’s evils long ago.Â  But hey, just another crazy religious person, if that’s not an oxymoron.

Gays can cause earthquakes? dam powerful people I’d be leaving alone then.

No, it doesn’t have the least bit to do with fracking.Â  Go to the USGS website and you can find maps that have all of the past earthquakes in Virginia listed.Â  We get them, just most aren’t really felt and they aren’t that often.Â  The more you know…

Noooo, Rabbi Yehuda Levin, God sent this earthquake to punish us because of YOU. Now, I don’t have any proof and it’s just a theory, but prove me wrong Rabbi Levin, huh huh, prove me wrong.

what a tool…………..why didn’t the earthquake hit isreal then ? they have greater gay rights in their WHOLE country than the u.s. of a…….

What bullshit!Â  Gays didn’t cause the earthquake.Â 

It would take a lot of guys rocking millions of beds to cause a quake.Â  Don’t you know the least thing about physics, Rabbi?

Funny that there’s no earthquakes in Berlin or Amsterdam. Â Lots of gay-bars, gay-pride parades and so on there.

IronicÂ when you can accurately predict these exact comments will happenÂ yet nothing could predict the quake.Â

Sorry, Rabbi, but according to another story on this very site, it was more likely fracking than f*cking that caused the quake.

LOL! I’m willing to bet that this silly asshat is simply dying for some earthquake-inducing homosexual sex! I’m convinced that all these over-the-top religious gay-blamers are merely self-haters railing and shouting from deep inside of their pathetic closets.

If I knew I could make an earthquake, I would have tried to be gay myself. Â And then I would quake the fucking shit out of any and all religious fucknuts I could find. Â 

It seems that homosexuals are more powerful than God. Either that, or God has no interest in preventing earthquakes.

So you’re religion should be forced down our throats instead? Â If you don’t like homosexuals, look the other way. Â Cause guess what? Â I promise you we were around long before you’re precious “Jesus” was born through supposed immaculate conception, and we’ll be here long after. Â I grew up in the church long enough to know that you’re all a bunch of hypocritical assholes that will twist the bible’s meaning to whatever suits you best. Â Ugh, enough of your hateful bullshit! Â Aren’t you supposed to love everyone no matter what? Â And didn’t Jesus hang out with whores? Â How about this for you? Â I’m gay in and Texas, if ‘god” hates homosexuals so much, let there be an earthquake in Tx tonight and I’ll believe your crap. Asshole!

If, and this is an huge if, Gays and Lesbians brought on an earthquake that didn’t kill anyone, because it displeased some supernatural voyeur, I think we can live with that.Â 

Yes, we cause earthquakes, hurricanes, tidal waves, lightening strikes and volcanoes. Don’t fuck with us or we’ll send you a monsoon.

Gee, I think Rabbi Levin’s repressed homosexuality caused the earthquake. Â If only he would be more open about it, I bet he’s going to remain repressed and God is going to cause yet another earthquake because of it. Thanx alot Rabbi!

Clearly, GOD sends earthquakes to remind Jews to give up their sinful religion and convert to Christianity. For as long as Jews recognize Jesus as their Messiah, we will continue to have earthquakes.

I’ve seen what a headboard can do to drywall, but a 5.8 magnitude earthquake? Rabbi, you watch way too much gay porn… and have wayyy too much imagination.

If homosexuals are causing earthquakes, maybe they should be should have sex at different times of the day. If the earth is moving for too many people at the same time, it obviously moves for all of us. Gays, stops having sex all at the same time. I think that is what he is trying to say.

I had no idea that a personâs sex life was so powerful. Mine has never produced a damn aftershock much less an earthquake.

I blame the earthquake on caring what some Rabbi blames it on.

It’s quacks like this that caused the quake…….fleabaggers and teabaggers what the hell is next.

The good rabbi thinks God shitting on the creatures he made is causing ‘quakes….

Damn you homosexuals, causing waves…and waves of earthquakes because of those blow jobs.

all I am going to say is this. Â If those gay people have that much power that they can cause earthquakes, I say let them get married and dance naked in the streets. Â Never in the history of man have people had so much power over nature. Â It just scares me to the bone

Rabbi, you got it backward. Earthquakes cause gay behavior. Say you’re in a crowded elevator when one of those babies hit – you’d be surprised as to what can go into what. Gives an entire new meaning to the term “7.0″

Virginia Earthquake 2011 – 5.8 magnitude earthquake shook the center of the Virginia Mid-Atlantic, sending shock waves up and down the east coast through Washington, DC, New York, and always in Concord, NH, and Toronto, Canada .

According to the Survey United States Geological Survey (USGS), the earthquake occurred at 13:51 pm at a depth of 3.7 miles. The earthquake was centered 27 miles east of Charlottesville, Virginia, near the town of Mineral in Louisa County, Virginia Earthquake 2011

Virginia Earthquake 2011 lasted up to 30 seconds.

Minutes after the earthquake, USGS Director Marcia McNutt – who have seen the fall of objects from the shelves of his office – has warned that the vibration may not be over.

There were no immediate reports of damage in Virginia Earthquake 2011. However, shipping times Richmond reports that the police began to receive calls from any property damage after the event.

Earthquake is not far from the plant Dominion Virginia Power North Anna nuclear power. The earthquake knocked out power, but utility to manually shut down two nuclear units without incident and the damage was visible, the Richmond Times Dispatch.

“We lost power on site, but all the diesel generators are operating,” Dominion spokesman Richard Zuercher said that 30 minutes after the earthquake. “Everything seems to work very well.”

William Harper, an employee of the city of minerals in Louisa County, reported “some damage to a building because of Virginia Earthquake 2011” in the municipal offices for the paper as well.

Japan Earthquake Magnitude – Several countries in the Pacific, South Asia, Latin America and North America also raised tsunami warnings. Places that have issued warnings include Japan, Taiwan, Indonesia, Russia, New Zealand, Philippines, Hawaii and Chile.

The quake struck at a depth of approximately15 miles from the epicenter 240 miles northeast of Tokyo. Within two hours 4-10 m high tsunami hit the east coast of Japan, sweeping away cars and boats inside. The structures have been damaged by the earthquake were still damaged and washed away by the tsunami.

Fire in several places along the coast, caused by broken gas lines, the structures were also burned. A large fire has also affected the oil refinery in Ichihara Chiba Cosmo City, near the capital. According to the Prime Minister, Naoto Kan, nuclear power plants were not affected. The Japanese government has sent troops to the affected Japan Earthquake Magnitude areas.

Arlyn Kobori, who lives in Saitama Prefecture, located in the northern part of Greater Tokyo, which is very near the epicenter, said that strong aftershocks continued for many hours after the great Japan Earthquake Magnitude. Water and gas were cut at home. Kobori said it was the most powerful quake she had felt in Japan.

“My son was about to leave for work, but the earthquake struck, before he was able to leave the house.” Kobori said. “We crawled under the table several times aftershocks kept coming and would not stop. “Kobori said she feared for her husband is not home, but with night and darkness creeps in Japan Earthquake Magnitude.

Earthquake in Virginia Today – East Coast is not an earthquake hot zone in those days. And Virginia is not sitting on an active seismic faults. It was an earthquake in the hot zone from 2 to 300 years. So what caused the earthquake in Virginia today?

Well, because it’s “blame the scars” left at that time, probably because the pressure can build up there and cause these earthquakes occur.

“We just have to see pressure buildup and release of these scars,” Karen Fischer, seimologist from Brown University, said. “There is much debate about exactly what is happening there, and exactly how that great earthquakes occur in such a zone of the crust.”

While earthquakes are less frequent on the east coast, but colder and firmer crust found on the West Coast, shock travel further and faster, so my sister and at least one East Coast writer of our felt the earthquake very clearly all the way to New York City.

So it is certainly stronger than many residents have probably experienced. In fact, the largest earthquake ever recorded in the history of Virginia, was held May 31, 1897 in Giles County, with an estimated magnitude of 5.8 which is what the preliminary reports that the recent history.

Before the earthquake today was the largest earthquake in Virginia 5.9 quake that struck in Giles County in 1897 and was felt in 12 states, according to US Geological Survey.

According to the website of the USGS, was the largest devastating earthquake in central Virginia seismic zone in 1875 was magnitude 4.8.

Virginia has had more than 160 earthquakes in the past three decades, but only about a sixth of their feeling.

Yes, Earthquake in Virginia Today is unusual.

Text messaging and data connections did not seem to be affected to the same degree.It was unclear if the network issues were a result of an overload of people using the network to make calls, or if any cellular towers were damaged in the earthquake.“We are seeing no reports of damage to our wireless network, which is built for reliability in situations like this,” said Tom Pica, a spokesman for Verizon Wireless. Mr. Pica said the network experienced “congestion in parts of the East for a short time after the tremors.”An AT&T spokeswoman said in an e-mail message: “We have no reports of network damage but we are seeing heavy call volumes.” T-Mobile said on Twitter: “T-Mobile’s network is experiencing higher call volumes in all areas affected by the earthquake. We advise customers to use SMS or e-mail.”Crystal Davis, a spokeswoman for Sprint, said in an e-mail message, “Customers did experience a slight delay in making and receiving calls in the hour or two immediately following the earthquake.” Ms. Davis said traffic on the network quickly returned to normal.“The industry’s infrastructure appears to be intact, but because many wireless consumers are using the networks, we are experiencing higher than normal traffic,” explained Amy Storey, a spokeswoman for CTIA, the wireless industry association. Ms. Storey said customers should try to use text messaging and avoid phone calls, which can saturate a network.There were hundreds of comments on Twitter from people in Virginia and New York noting that cellphone service was intermittent or completely unavailable.

6 May 11: Japan shuts down more reactors. The government asks for two south of Tokyo at Harnakoa, atop a fault, to be closed pending reviews of earthquake vulnerability.

This article was originally published by ElectionOnline. To read the original article, please click here. We’re glad that everyone remained unharmed during the East Coast earthquake on election day!

The East Coast experienced a rare magnitude 5.8 earthquake at 1:51 p.m. on Tuesday. The epicenter of the quake was located in Mineral, Va.

In Louisa County, where the epicenter of the earthquake was located, Cristy Watkins, registrar of voters, said things went extremely well considering the circumstances.

With phone lines overwhelmed in the minutes following the quake, deputy registrars fanned out to the six affected polling places to check on poll workers and voters.

The Stafford County fire marshal inspected all 27 of the counties polling sites shortly after the quake and deemed them all safe and voting continued even though some of the polling place hosts tried to shut-down operations.

“We said no, we don’t do that on election day,” Registrar Greg Riddlemoser told The Freelance Star.”I’m very, very proud of the response of the precinct workers. Nobody really thinks that you’re going to have an earthquake on election day. I’m very pleased with the calm nature and the business mentality” of the poll officials.

About an hour after the earthquake, City of Falls Church Registrar Dave Bjerke quipped on Facebook, “Falls Church will not be suppressed. Outside the polls voting!”

It was largely business as usual for Fairfax County, one of the state’s largest and most populated counties. A number of polling places were evacuated when the earthquake happened so they could assess if there was structural damage and all facilities that were evacuated set up in the parking lot with the voting machines running on battery power.

Operations in the county elections office were not affected by the earthquake although Cortes noted that they definitely felt the tremors.

“While our emergency plans contemplate blizzards, hurricanes, and even terrorist attacks, earthquakes weren’t really on our list of issues to plan for,” Cortes said. “I think our staff and election officers in the field performed incredibly well and ensured that we continued voting the entire day without more than a few minutes of interruption.”

That’s also true of the unexpected DC earthquake last week.  The picture of the overturned lawn chair is funny and all, but because the region doesn’t get a lot of earthquakes, some of the infrastructure was unprepared.  And while disaster has hopefully been avoided, this should raise caution, especially with respect to one nuclear plant in Virginia:

The earthquake that prompted the shutdown of a Virginia nuclear power plant last week may have been more severe than the plant’s reactors were designed to withstand, federal regulators said.

The revelation is likely to put increased pressure on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to quickly implement a series of safety recommendations intended in part to protect plants from major natural disasters like earthquakes.

NRC said Monday that its preliminary analysis indicates that the ground motion caused by the magnitude-5.8 earthquake near the North Anna Power Station in Louisa County, Va., exceeded the maximum level the two reactors at the plant were built to handle.

Nuclear plants cannot lose power.  This has been the source of much of the trouble in Fukushima.  In the case of North Anna, offsite power was lost, but backup diesel generators kicked in.  However, if the plant started to crumble because it wasn’t built to withstand an earthquake of that magnitude, power could have become an issue.  And then a hugely populated area could have been materially affected.

A few things here.  First of all, these are the kinds of problems you simply don’t have with other forms of renewable energy.  Second, as natural disasters grow more frequent, improving critical infrastructure design is just another cost of climate change, one that doesn’t get scored by the CBO, but one which exists and drains budgets.  Third, it’s worth looking into whether one form of energy production – fracking – is leading to natural occurrences like earthquakes that threaten other forms of energy production.

The earthquake that prompted the shutdown of a Virginia nuclear power plant last week may have been more severe than the plant’s reactors were designed to withstand, federal regulators said.

I would be surprised if any non-West Coast nuclear plants are adequately hardened for earthquakes.  That includes plants near the New Madrid Fault in Missouri-Illinois-Iowa and plants near the faults that caused earthquakes in Charleston and Edgefield SC.

I have conferred with people in the oil industry that I know and confirmed from them that this earthquake could have been caused by fracking taking place along the eastern seaboard. Same for recent earthquakes in Arkansas.

in﻿ california, earthquakes are horrible.

I live in Maryland. We were in Quantico, VA when my folks and I felt it. We visited the US Marine museum there and we were in the building when we felt it. When earthquake happens, you usually swing side to side or back and forth﻿ but dis one was different.

I didn't mean to say this but this video totally made laugh. You were video taping then it's started to rumble and you still had no idea﻿ what was going on after five seconds. The earthquake was scary. It did feel like there was a train coming.

and its not funny in the east coast. why? cuz in the﻿ west coast mainly southern california, the houses are made to resist earthquakes and over there there made of brick and hard stuff to resit hurricanes (im right?0 so i hope your ok

After the big earthquake on Tuesday, significant structural damage was reported at several Washington landmarks including the Washington Monument and the Smithsonian Castle. Another one, less recognizable to most folks, but key in our personal geography, is the Embassy of Ecuador. Not only is it an outpost of my wife’s dual citizenship, but it also happens to be located adjacent to Meridian Hill Park (a.k.a. “Malcolm X Park”), a few blocks from where we live in Columbia Heights.

Yesterday morning, after a pre-hurricane run through the Zoo (visiting those putative quake-predictors, the gorillas and lemurs), we detoured past the Ecuadorian Embassy to see if any of the damage was visible from the outside. Indeed it was. After a shower and some breakfast, we walked back armed with our cameras to document what we saw.

As I indicated at the end of Wednesday’s post about damage to my condo, chimneys are a huge risk in earthquakes because they are (a) often constructed from unreinforced masonry which has very low shear strength, and (b) relatively massive, which gives them a lot of inertia. As the ground accelerates out from underneath the building, the chimney’s inertia keeps it where it was. Then, as it finally gets moving, trying to catch up to the rest of the structure, the building beneath it has switched direction, moving back in the opposite direction. Without some internal or external reinforcement like rebar, this is a sure recipe from breaking your chimney into chunks. If your chimney is four storeys above street level, that can present problems for anyone on the sidewalk below.

Pre-crumbled structures like this are a big reason that we should still be vigilant during aftershocks, even if they are lesser in magnitude than the original quake (a point also made by the “5 myths about earthquakes” article in yesterday’s Post that you should definitely read).

Notice how only the chimney above this strut snapped off – the brace helped keep the lower portion of the chimney mechanically bound to the rest of the building so that they moved together during the earthquake. Shear was thus minimized for the lower portion of the chimney, and accordingly it did not fail.

Scenes like this should remind us city folk that during an earthquake, it’s better to shelter in place (indoors, under a desk or in a doorway) than to run outside onto the street. Total building collapse is rare; flying debris is common. If you are outside, move the heck away from buildings – and keep in mind that unreinforced masonry may be on its way down to meet you.

So what you’re looking for is not “magnitude” (which is a measure that corresponds to the absolute amount of energy released at the site of the quake itself), but a fuzzier quantity which is dubbed “intensity.”

But, were there any real measurements taken at locations outside the epicenter, say, DC perhaps? The damage seems consistent with a larger quake.

Nice chimney shot!  It might have been the chimney brace that actually snapped the 2nd one, those things are notoriously bad for seismic.  I’m really looking into the chance that this earthquake is induced by the dammed lake, but the lack of any seismic monitoring is a bummer.  Hopefully they are bringing in more.

Is it possible that in using HAARP to try to steer hurricane Irene away from the eastern seaboard and minimize the potential for widespread catastrophic damage from what meteorologists say could come ashore as a monster category 4 hurricane—is it possible that the Virginia earthquake was accidentally induced? Extensive information available to the public implies the answer is yes.

As far as the Virginia earthquake being a product of HAARP, please learn more about this technology, and decide for yourself. There is great possibility that HAARP has already affected all of our lives in ways that seem incredible. 

They are steering the hurricane. However, it's not like steering a 300ZX and the storm can't be turned with pin point accuracy. If you look at a line from Alaska to where the hurricane was beginning to turn sharply, VA is right in the path.One huge point everyone is missing is that most cell service went out 6 hours prior to the earthquake within 250 miles of epicenter

My first though was that the unusual quake along our East Coast was somehow related to Japan's 9.0 earthquake. That quake shifted the position of Earth's axis by 6.5 inches. It had been 1200 years since a quake of this magnitude hit Japan's plate boundary.

The 2011 East Coast earthquake shook unsuspecting residents from Georgia to New York.

It was surprising because the East Coast does not frequently experience earthquakes strong enough to be felt.

The East Coast earthquake on Aug. 23, 2011 caused no major damage, injuries, or death, according to USA Today.  However, it did spook millions of people, set Twitter ablaze with comments, prompted widespread (but short) evacuations, and caused traffic jams.

The reactions to the earthquake were mostly humorous and incredulous due to the lack of serious consequences.

- Can someone hurry up and make an #obama and #earthquake joke. Its been at least 3 seconds….. 

- Earthquake scared me SO bad at work today..cool experience but pretty terrifying

Photos of evacuations and other impacts of the earthquake are posted above (left).

The 5.8-magitude earthquake struck a location 38 miles outside of Richmond, Va. at 1:51 p.m. ET, according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).  It occurred in the previously known Central Virginia Seismic Zone, which has produced small tremors since at least the 18th century.

In 2003, a 4.5 magnitude earthquake also caused some minor damage.

The USGS stated that “earthquakes in the central and eastern U.S., although less frequent than in the western U.S., are typically felt over a much broader region.”

It’s been an eventful week here in Northern Virginia. On Tuesday we had an earthquake, 5.8 on the Richter magnitude scale, shaking lots of things at home and work to the floor. Almost immediately, on Wednesday, we began making preparations for hurricane Irene, the largest of its kind to move up the east coast of the United States in more than 50 years. In both cases, it’s been harder than usual to count on gadgets like mobile phones, iPads, tablets, and laptops.

For more than an hour after the earthquake, making mobile phone calls was difficult, though I found I was able to text easily. Now, during hurricane Irene (I am sitting by a window watching the rain fall in sheets), I worry about maintaining the battery charge of each gadget as long as possible, since the power is sure to go out at some point. Of greater concern is that, with millions of people losing power, it may take some time to get the power restored. Preservation becomes even more of a concern.

Yesterday in the District of Columbia (my school) and Virginia (my home), we had an earthquake, the largest quake in our area in 70 years. At school things rumbled and doors slammed, so most of the adults, who were preparing for the start of the school year, headed outside for a bit. At my house I returned to find pictures askew. A few things fell on the floor at home, but my neighbor checked on the house and picked them up before I arrived.

A few minutes ago, an earthquake struck the East Coast of the U.S., centered near Richmond, Virginia, says the U.S. Geological Survey, which gave it a preliminary magnitude rating of 5.8 (just updated to 5.9). Tremors were felt all throughout the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast--the PopSci headquarters in Midtown Manhattan shook a bit, causing a minor nerd panic. No injuries or damage have been reported yet.

Colorado was hit with a 5.3 magnitude earthquake yesterday, the state's biggest in decades. A series of minor earthquakes hit Northern and Southern California last week, with some continuing today, but the big one today was centered in Northern Virginia, near Richmond. Though no injuries or damage have been reported, several news sources are reporting that the Pentagon and U.S. Capitol building, both located nearby, have been evacuated. Cell phone service in New York city appears spotty, especially AT&T, though it's not clear whether that's related to the earthquake or the high number of calls undoubtedly being placed right now. 

Solar flares, near miss asteroids, tsunami, earth quakes, wars, disease, famine, world economic down turn,December 21, 2012 is not to far away.

I live in Richmond, VA.  Inside the one-story office where I work, it felt like a low flying plane (really low).  Once we got outside, you had to sit on the ground to feel it, but you could still see the glass doors shaking.  Most people in cars didn't even realize there was an earthquake.  I did hear from a co-worker's boyfriend that he witnessed a swimmer who couldn't get out of a pool because the waves trapped her in the middle.

I felt it here in Michigan. It felt like I was on a boat (www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7yfISlGLNU). My boss was like, "do you feel that?" I had thought it was just me and I suddenly was taken ill. That was the first time I've ever actually felt an Earth quake. Pretty wild.

Since I'm from California, I can't help feeling a little bit amused by people on the east coast freaking out about an earthquake. That being said, an earthquake over there is actually a serious matter, since buildings in that region generally aren't specifically built to withstand earthquakes and preparations for what to do in the event of an earthquake are more or less non-existent there.

Solar flares, near-miss asteroids, tsunamis, earthquakes, wars, disease, and famine have all been with us over the course of our brief existence on this planet. As for world economic downturn, it has happened before, during the Great Depression. Also, back when the world was a smaller place, the Roman Empire suffered an economic crisis as well. If these events seem more frequent or brand new, I submit that it's mostly or entirely due to advances in communications, which have brought information about nearly every natural or man-made disaster in the world right to our doorstep. Look into the past, and you'll see that we weren't always so knowledgeable about events on our planet or out in the rest of the universe. In fact, it used to be so bad that we were only aware of events in our small part of the world, which we thought of as our entire world at the time. Of course, for some people in remote or developing parts of the world, that limited perspective still exists because they don't have access to or can't afford luxuries like computers, smart phones, books, magazines, or newspapers.

Not to forget Japan: "....A nuclear power plant in central Virginia has lost offsite power in the wake of a 5.8 earthquake centered northwest of Richmond, Va., U.S. nuclear officials said.The North Anna Power Station, which has two nuclear reactors, is now using four diesel generators to maintain cooling operations. The plant automatically shut down in the wake of the earthquake...,..."As far as we know, everything is safe," said Nuclear Regulatory Commission spokesman David McIntyre.

sheesh :) that was fun :) I was in the second story of a two story building. at first it felt like someone dropped a big object that would have vibrated the floor, but I noticed the chair in which I sat was shaking in a circular type pattern when I realized that it was an earthquake. I near bolted for the door if I wasn't so far from an exit !!!

Been through multiple earthquakes living on the west coast...  The most recent of which was in Hawaii...  A 4.6 earthquake was responsible for knocking out power for around 24+ hours...  That was fun... Then there was Seattle area over 10 years ago...  didnt really notice that one.  Woke up the next day having heard that there was an earthquake...  the day went a long as normal.

The Anna nuclear power plant, hit by the Virginia Earthquake, was forced to release steam after losing electricity and a generator used to cool the plant failed.

Earlier today two of the nuclear power plants at the epicenter of today’s 5.9 earthquake were taken offline due to a power outage. The cooling functions at those plants were switched to run off emergency backup generators. 1 of the 4 generators failed within minutes despite an earlier NRC inspection and certification the generators were fit to use in the event of an emergency like today.

The NRC is now reporting one of the four back up generators that has been shutdown at the epicenter of the 5.9 Virginia earthquake has failed.

There has been a series of unusual events at nuclear power plants across the nation from North Carolina to Virgina following today’s 5.9 earthquake that struck with an epicenter near Mineral, Virginia’s Anna nuclear power plant. The earthquake caused power outages at the Anna plant which forced workers to shutdown the reactors and switch to emergency backup generator’s to cool the nuclear fuel rods at the reactor. While the NRC supposedly tested and certified the safety and functionality at the nuclear plant following the Fukushima nuclear meltdown, the NRC is now reporting that one of the backup generators at the plant failed just moments after being started.

As reported earlier the media initially ignored reporting on the status of the Anna nuclear power plant near the epicenter of today’s Virgina earthquake.

Media Silent On Fate Of Anna Nuclear Plant At Epicenter Of 5.9 Mineral Virginia Earthquake

A massive 5.9 earthquake, the largest ever in recorded history, which has been felt across the U.S. from Colorado To Massachusetts, has an epicenter near Mineral Virginia’s Anna Nuclear Power Plant.

After raising the question on why the media was being silent on the fate of the Anna Virginia nuclear reactors we learn the earthquake has taken 9 nuclear plants offline.

The earthquake triggered the automatic shutdown of a nuclear power plant less than 20 miles from the epicenter after it lost electricity. The quake signaled “unusual events” at 12 other nuclear facilities across the East Coast and Michigan, U.S. authorities reported.

The  EPA radnet radiation monitors in the area, which display radiation data controlled and supplied by the government, has not  shown any radiation spikes in the areas surrounding the epicenter of the earthquake.

The original  Mineral Virginia earthquake has been followed by four aftershocks so far. Experts warn that aftershocks continued for weeks  following the 5.9 earthquake that hit nearby Blacksburg in 1897.

At 2:46:50 pm, a 2.8 magnitude aftershock was felt in Louisa. According to the USGS, the epicenter was five miles southwest of the Town of Mineral and approximately one mile from the center of the original earthquake (37.931°N, 77.935°W). Read the USGS report on the first aftershock here.

A strong earthquake in Virginia shut down a nearby nuclear power plant Tuesday afternoon and sent out seismic waves felt by millions from Georgia to northern New England. Three aftershocks were reported by Tuesday evening.

Smart Meters – Top Spying, Distructive Health Tool Virginia Earthquake – Nuclear Wake-Up Call for U.S. (Nuclear Plants not Prepared) 

At approximately 2:00pm, a 5.9 magnitude Earthquake hit Virginia yesterday, Tuesday August 24th. Although it struck 300 miles away, the entire East Coast shook, including Jackson Heights, New York.

The epicenter of the earthquake was near Mineral, Virginia; about 85 miles outside our nation’s capital of Washington, DC.  According to an article posted by ABC WorldNews, “the pillars of the capital in Washington, DC shook. Alarms sounded in the FBI and Department of Justice buildings, and some flooding was reported on an upper floor of the Pentagon as a result of the quake.”

Queens residents spoke to the Queens Courier, reporting their experience with the quake. “I felt the earthquake. It was weird. I didn’t know what to do,” said Lisa Heron of Springfield Gardens. She added that she was “relieved when it stopped.” Another Queens resident from Bayside said he was “sure it was either construction or the train,” (Queens Courier).  

The last recorded earthquake to rattle the Northeast Coast was in November of 2010, when a minor 3.9 magnitude quake was detected off the coast of Long Island from Massapequa to East Hampton.

Virginia Earthquake 2011: 4.2 Magnitude Aftershock Felt in Virginia, More Likely to Come | Christian Media Cross

Virginia Earthquake 2011: 4.2 Magnitude Aftershock Felt in Virginia, More Likely to Come

Hours after the initial quake, an aftershock measuring 4.2 on the Richter scale struck the region of Mineral, Virginia, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS).

The 4.2 magnitude aftershock, which occurred around 8:04 p.m., was the third on Tuesday and had a depth of 4.9 miles and follows a 5.8 magnitude earthquake that occurred in the same area earlier Tuesday.

The first two aftershocks were measured to be less than one mile underground. Just 45 minutes after the initial quake, a magnitude 2.8 aftershock occurred around 2:45 p.m., about 45 miles south of Mineral. The second aftershock occurred around 3:20 p.m. with a magnitude of 2.2.

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) has confirmed that a 5.9 magnitude earthquake struck central Virginia at 1:51 pm EDT. It is the strongest quake to hit the Virginia area since 1897.

According to USGS, the quake happened at 1:51 p.m. at a depth of 3.7 miles. The quake was centered 27 miles east of Charlottesville, Va., near the town of Mineral in Louisa County, Va. The movement lasted for no more than 30 seconds.	    

Tuesday’s earthquake was felt in New York City, Boston, upstate New York, Cleveland, Charlotte, N.C., and even Martha’s Vineyard.

“The rocks are old and cold and they carry the seismic energy very far,” Blanpeid told the Washington Post in explanation of the widespread effects. “Even a magnitude 6 or less earthquake can be felt over a considerably large area, unlike California where the shaking is more concentrated.”

Although most Americans associate earthquakes with the West Coast, this is not Virginia’s first earthquake, and the state “is not an unexpected location for an earthquake,” John Ebel, director of the Boston College Weston Observatory, told The Boston Globe.

Washington memorials closed after US East Coast is shaken by a 5.8-magnitude quake

Terrifying tremors were felt in New York, Washington D.C. and as far north as Toronto on Tuesday when America's East Coast was struck by the biggest earthquake in over a century.Major buildings, including the Pentagon and the White House had to be evacuated and several top tourist attractions in Washington have been closed for safety reasons after the city was shaken by a 5.8-magnitude quake, which originated in Virginia.Flights from JFK in New York and Reagan National Airport in Washington were also suspended while the airports checked for runway damage, but were later resumed. Scroll down for video 

Trains were temporarily suspended due to the quake and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg confirmed the suspension bridges in the city were checked for damage.The 5.9-magnitude tremor struck at about 2pm local time with shallow tremors of about 3.7 miles deep, which is thought to explain why the shaking was so widespread.The U.S. Geological Survey said the earthquake was half a mile deep and centred near Louisa, Virginia, about 40 miles north west of Richmond.

Is it possible that in using HAARP to try to steer hurricane Irene away from the eastern seaboard and minimize the potential for widespread catastrophic damage from what meteorologists say could come ashore as a monster category 4 hurricane—is it possible that the Virginia earthquake was accidentally induced? Extensive information available to the public implies the answer is yes.

As far as the Virginia earthquake being a product of HAARP, please learn more about this technology, and decide for yourself. There is great possibility that HAARP has already affected all of our lives in ways that seem incredible. 

They are steering the hurricane. However, it's not like steering a 300ZX and the storm can't be turned with pin point accuracy. If you look at a line from Alaska to where the hurricane was beginning to turn sharply, VA is right in the path.One huge point everyone is missing is that most cell service went out 6 hours prior to the earthquake within 250 miles of epicenter

My first though was that the unusual quake along our East Coast was somehow related to Japan's 9.0 earthquake. That quake shifted the position of Earth's axis by 6.5 inches. It had been 1200 years since a quake of this magnitude hit Japan's plate boundary.

"Hey! Stop kicking my fuckin' bench! Stop kickin' my bench!" That's how I first noticed yesterday's 5.8 earthquake in Virginia, sitting in Tompkins Square Park eating my lunch, with an obviously disturbed homeless man trying to sleep a few benches down. 

My bench was shaking too, feeling like someone was excessively into their music and taping out the beat. But with no one obviously rocking out nearby I immediately wondered if it was an earthquake. Apparently I was a minute faster than the internet, as my iPhone search yielded no recent results for 'earthquake NYC 2011'. 

I guessed New York just got a perhaps a 4.0 quake, but 5.8 in Virginia must feel like that several hundred miles away. In any case, it felt less strong to me than being woken in a Mumbai hotel by the 7.7 Gujarat earthquake in 2001.

This video of the seismic waves below is beyond a doubt cool on the face of it (I was going to share it with you all before Jaymi beat me to it), but if it was caption "Twitter waves move across the nation after rare Virginia quake" you'd probably believe me for a second. After all Twitter hit 5,500 tweets per second at the height of it all.

Jumping on the bandwagon of highlighting nuclear power plants in the US in earthquake zones--as plenty of people did (including this site) based on a brief survey of Facebook--seemed painfully stretching the situation. Not to mention feeding into fears rather than addressing them constructively.

It's understandable that everyone was abuzz wondering what was happening, but you know what: Yesterday's Virginia earthquake was of approximately 1,000 times lower intensity than the one which struck Japan earlier this year, or the one which happened off Chile in 2010. It was 100 times less intense than the one which killed 68,000 people in Sichuan, China in 2008. It was roughly 10 times less intense than the one which ruined Haiti last year (a testament to better building codes here that more damage didn't occur I suppose).

The East Coast was rattled Tuesday by a rare earthquake. (more)

There have been at least five aftershocks following Tuesday's east coast earthquake,  including one big one overnight.

The magnitude 4.5 earthquake was centered about 31 miles east of Charlottesville, Virginia. at 1:07 a.m. EST Thursday.

UPDATED ON WEDNESDAY AUGUST 24:  The 5.8-magnitude earthquake Tuesday that shook people from Georgia to Canada has produced at least four aftershocks. The U.S. Geological Survey says the aftershocks around the central Virginia epicenter ranged in magnitude from 4.2 to as little as 2.2 since the strongest earthquake to strike the East Coast since World War II.

Amy Vaughan, a geophysicist with the National Earthquake Information Center in Colorado, says the number of aftershocks so far has been remarkably low. Vaughan says the agency isn't sure what to expect, but it's likely there will be some more for days, if not weeks. Typically, the larger the quake, the longer and the greater extent of aftershocks.

POSTED ON TUESDAY AUGUST 23: A 5.8 magnitude earthquake centered northwest of Richmond, Va., shook much of Washington, D.C., and was felt as far north as Rhode Island and New York City.

The U.S. Geological Survey said the earthquake happened around 1:51 PM. They say it was was 3.7 miles deep.

Shaking was felt at the White House and all over the East Coast, as far south as Chapel Hill, N.C. Parts of the Pentagon, White House and Capitol were evacuated. The quake was in Mineral, Va., in Louisa County.

You can help the US Geological Survey better understand earthquakes. Let them know if you felt ut by going to their website http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/dyfi/

Federal officials say nuclear plants from North Carolina to Michigan are under increased scrutiny after the quake.    

The quake was also felt at the Surry nuclear plant near Newport News, but a spokesman said both reactors there continued to operate safely.

Shattered: Part of the library's roof crumbled during the 5.9 magnitude earthquake 

The Anna nuclear power plant, hit by the Virginia Earthquake, was forced to release steam after losing electricity and a generator used to cool the plant failed.

Earlier today two of the nuclear power plants at the epicenter of today’s 5.9 earthquake were taken offline due to a power outage. The cooling functions at those plants were switched to run off emergency backup generators. 1 of the 4 generators failed within minutes despite an earlier NRC inspection and certification the generators were fit to use in the event of an emergency like today.

The NRC is now reporting one of the four back up generators that has been shutdown at the epicenter of the 5.9 Virginia earthquake has failed.

There has been a series of unusual events at nuclear power plants across the nation from North Carolina to Virgina following today’s 5.9 earthquake that struck with an epicenter near Mineral, Virginia’s Anna nuclear power plant. The earthquake caused power outages at the Anna plant which forced workers to shutdown the reactors and switch to emergency backup generator’s to cool the nuclear fuel rods at the reactor. While the NRC supposedly tested and certified the safety and functionality at the nuclear plant following the Fukushima nuclear meltdown, the NRC is now reporting that one of the backup generators at the plant failed just moments after being started.

As reported earlier the media initially ignored reporting on the status of the Anna nuclear power plant near the epicenter of today’s Virgina earthquake.

Media Silent On Fate Of Anna Nuclear Plant At Epicenter Of 5.9 Mineral Virginia Earthquake

A massive 5.9 earthquake, the largest ever in recorded history, which has been felt across the U.S. from Colorado To Massachusetts, has an epicenter near Mineral Virginia’s Anna Nuclear Power Plant.

After raising the question on why the media was being silent on the fate of the Anna Virginia nuclear reactors we learn the earthquake has taken 9 nuclear plants offline.

The earthquake triggered the automatic shutdown of a nuclear power plant less than 20 miles from the epicenter after it lost electricity. The quake signaled “unusual events” at 12 other nuclear facilities across the East Coast and Michigan, U.S. authorities reported.

The  EPA radnet radiation monitors in the area, which display radiation data controlled and supplied by the government, has not  shown any radiation spikes in the areas surrounding the epicenter of the earthquake.

The original  Mineral Virginia earthquake has been followed by four aftershocks so far. Experts warn that aftershocks continued for weeks  following the 5.9 earthquake that hit nearby Blacksburg in 1897.

At 2:46:50 pm, a 2.8 magnitude aftershock was felt in Louisa. According to the USGS, the epicenter was five miles southwest of the Town of Mineral and approximately one mile from the center of the original earthquake (37.931°N, 77.935°W). Read the USGS report on the first aftershock here.

A strong earthquake in Virginia shut down a nearby nuclear power plant Tuesday afternoon and sent out seismic waves felt by millions from Georgia to northern New England. Three aftershocks were reported by Tuesday evening.

-No major injuries or extensive damage were reported after the 5.8-magnitude earthquake.

-The quake prompted evacuations of office buildings and the precautionary closing of monuments in the nation’s capital.

- The quake, which was recorded at 1:51 p.m., was shallow — just 3.7 miles deep

- Eearthquake slowed but didn’t halt major transportation services.

- Service at major airports initially disrupted by resumed normal operations 75 minutes after the earthquake struck.

Harmless very shallow earthquake well felt by tourists and people  living close to the epicenter.

eathquake lasting maybe 3-4 seconds.”

UPDATE: Mining and energy operations in Peru were not affected by the earthquake.

UPDATE: The main oil pipeline in Pucallpa apparently was not damaged during the earthquake.

Very strong deep earthquake with possibilty of some damage.

The earthquake was registered first as a magnitude 6.8 cutremure.

Peru’s Institute of Geophysics registered the quake’s magnitude at 7. 

the hypocenter of the quake was much deeper. This is the reason why we do not expect 

Very well felt shallow moderate earthquake by people living close to the epicenter.

Shallow moderate earthquake very will felt by people living near the epicenter.

Moderate earthquake of MMI V has been reported in ‘I have felt’ (USGS) section from different places like  Matawan, Pennington, Brooklyn, Allentown, West Grove, Pottstown, Reading, Claymont, Gaithersburg, Frederick, Annandale, MC Lean, Fredericksburg, Midlothian, Martinsville etc.

EarthquakeThe quake hit around 2pm ET and was centered about 100 miles south of Washington, DC. In Virginia.It was felt as far north as New York and Rhode Island.

This is the same day that Prophet Owuor predicted an earthquake will hit the western world in the near future. The city will have tall skycraper buildings, it will be at night, The﻿ quake will last 42 secs and will break land so badly it will turn it in an anit clock wise position. This will be a sign from God. Repent! Jesus is coming. 

just an earthquake guys!Dont be afraid of..I see you re not﻿ quite used to in earthquakes..

@kjburger12 your thinking of the New Madrid fault near the Mississipi r. in1811 and 1812 there were 3 quakes﻿ in the 7.8 to8.2 magnitude. on the modified mercalli scale a measure of shaking intensity 1-12 it est they were @9-11 by comparison the 5.9 quake you felt was a 7. this quake might be a sign of more seismic on its way or could be a foreshck of a quake that that wont happen for 50-100 yrs. if the New Madrid goes off it wont be pretty.

@AnimalCrossing4ev Sorry for your lost. But i beleive this is a earthquake. And pretty soon a hurricane :(﻿

For 99 years, the Cherry Blossom Festival in Washington DC have heralded the arrival of Spring. This year, the cherry blossoms take on special meaning in the wake of the overwhelming events in Japan. 3000 cherry trees were a gift of friendship to the United States from Japan in 1912. Today, the trees are a symbol of hope and renewal as the US responds to Japan's time of need. Organizers of the festival held a vigil for victims of the earthquake and tsunami of March 11. DC Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton said the cherry blossoms will be a reminder of Japan's resiliency. "This year, the cherry blossoms will remind the world to stand for Japan," Norton said.

It'd be funny if this guy didn't steal this from someone else that posted it after the Indiana quake last year.

Umm thanks to the people that are just trying to be nice, but the rest of you that were in the quake area...you guys are retarded. I live in this area and that quake was barely more than an off balance washer.  Try not to over complicate your day or be greedy for attention. Find something more productive to do.

That chair is defective! Failed to withstand the meerest earthquake testing. Send it back to China for remelting.

Ok, I thought to jokes about the earthquake today were very insensitive BUT I must say this one got a laugh outta me soooooo....Here's my funny comment (in my CNN reporter voice)OMG!!!!!  That patch of grass under the chair will NEVER recover!!!!!

Reminds me of that '30 Rock' episode where they pre-recorded telethons for every conceivable disaster. Do you think they had one for DC earthquakes?

Congress has just passed a law banning the use of hazardous lawn chairs as a precaution against future earthquakes.

Earthquakes can happen anywhere! You just have to be prepared. http://wp.me/p1DjYf-2t

Looks like a several billion dollar clean up will be required. Then the analysis of this epic tragedy. The earth quake will be called: Obama's Fault.

Umm... funny as it is, but does anybody notice that this picture is dated July 2010?This is not from yesterday's earthquake.. just saying.

Lindsay the picture is not to say that there was no damage near the actual epicenter everyone pretty much has taken the picture to refer how just seconds after the quake all of the chicken littles ran out of the government buildings like the world was coming to an end. The picture is meant to portray how inept the government would truly be in a real crisis.Y.i Song it wouldn't matter if the pic was dated 50 years ago its portrayal and comments about the government and DC proper are pretty much spot on.

I should have more accurately stated that the article was posted on 2010..(I didn't even realize there was an earthquake in 2010 in DC region.) yes 5.9 quake isn't very strong an earthquake (esp to those from West coast), but it did more than flip a lawn chair this time around.. I do find the picture funny, though!

**BREAKING NEWS**: The Weather Channel says yesterdays east coast earthquake was caused by an unknown fault line running under D.C. and through Virginia. Theorists are still indecisive as to whether it is Obama's Fault or Bush's Fault and are contemplating another theory, saying that it may be the founding fathers rolling over in their graves. Lastly, the possibility remains that the earthquake may just be the effects of a 14.6 trillion dollar check bouncing in Washington.

Joe "China In A Bull Sh*p" Biden was axed about the East Coast Earthquake while he was in China and said, "It's Bush's Fault". (sorry)

After raising the question on why the media was being silent on the fate of the Anna Virginia nuclear reactors we learn the earthquake has taken 2 nuclear plants offline.

A little over an hour ago I reported the media was being unusually quiet about the fate of the Anna nuclear power plant at the epicenter of the Virginia quake after receiving an phone call about the reactor.

Media Silent On Fate Of Anna Nuclear Plant At Epicenter Of 5.9 Mineral Virginia Earthquake

A massive 5.9 earthquake, the largest ever in recorded history, which has been felt across the U.S. from Colorado To Massachusetts,  has an epicenter near Mineral Virginia’s Anna Nuclear Power Plant.

The 2011 Virginia earthquake was a magnitude 5.9 (Mw) intraplate earthquake that occurred on August 23, 2011. The focus is reported by the USGS to be about 64 km (39 mi) northwest of Richmond, Virginia near the town of Mineral, Virginia.

The earthquake was the highest-magnitude event in Virginia in recorded history.

The epicenter of the quake Mineral Virginia, which is the location of the Anna Nuclear Power Plant.

According MSNBC, the plant was among the list of nuclear power plants at most risk to suffer core damage from an earthquake.

The nuclear meltdown in Japan didn’t happen because of the Tsunami as they first told us. The meltdown was caused by damage from the earthquake before the Tsunami hit.  While it may have been a 9.0 earthquake out in the Pacific, it was only a 6.4 at the nuclear power plant itself.

Since then 9 unusual events have been declared at nuclear reactors following the quake and the NRC reports that the two nuclear reactors hit directly by the quake have been taken offline.

Two nuclear reactors were taken offline at the North Anna Power Station due to the earthquakes in Virgina.

Federal officials say two nuclear reactors at the North Anna Power Station in Louisa County, Va., were automatically taken off line by safety systems around the time of the earthquake.

She said the energy from earthquakes on the East Coast does not attenuate as quickly as it does on the West Coast, and thus even a relatively modest tremor can shake a very broad [area].

“When something like this happen, everyone has to remember, more than half of the states in the U.S. are considered earthquake country. When something like this happens, remember what to do in the case of a seismic event. Duck, get under something sturdy like a desk or a doorway, get away from falling glass. Make sure that you are not in the way of falling objects like pictures, bookshelves, books, anything that’s not firmly connected the wall.”

CNN is reporting that 9 nuclear power plants have declared an unusual event after the earthquake. Stay tuned as more news comes in.

Nuclear industry watchdogs warn the North Anna nuclear plant may be leaking radioactive tritium due to damage in underground pipes from the Virginia earthquake.

 The 5.8 magnitude Virginia earthquake of 2011 occurred at  1:51 p.m. (EDT) Tuesday, Aug. 23, in the Central Virginia Seismic Zone,  which is believed to have produced the strongest magnitude in the  history of Virginia in May 1897, a 5.9 earthquake in Giles County.   The U.S. Geological Survey says the area has produced “small and moderate earthquakes since at least the 18th century.” The last known earthquake to have originated from the zone's  epicenter occurred in 1875, when effective seismographs were not  invented, but the damage from the shock suggested that it had a  magnitude of about 4.8, USGS said. “The 1875 earthquake shook bricks from chimneys, broke plaster and  windows, and overturned furniture at several locations,” the agency's  statement said. Another earthquake from the Central Virginia Seismic Zone that caused  minor damage occurred Dec. 9, 2003, and had a magnitude 4.5. Though Virginia earthquakes rarely have caused injury, tremors can be felt over a wide region.

East of the Rockies, an earthquake can be felt over an area as much  as 10 times larger than a similar magnitude earthquake on the West  Coast,” USGS stated. Here are a few maps that explain the earthquake, its locations,  shocks that were felt across eastern U.S., damages it caused and more.According to the USGS PAGER (Prompt Assessment of Global Earthquakes for  Response) system that provides shaking, fatality and economic loss  impact estimates following significant earthquakes worldwide, the  shaking alert level for the Virginia earthquake is orange, which  accounts for economic losses only. Significant damage is likely and the  disaster is potentially widespread.

SANTA BARBARA, Calif., Aug. 24, 2011 --     /PRNewswire/ -- The largest earthquake to hit Virginia in more than a century struck Louisa County yesterday.The 5.9 earthquake hit Virginia at 1:51 p.m. on August 23, but the effects were felt in several states including Washington, New York City and North Carolina.No injuries or major damage were reported but many buildings were evacuated and masses of people flooded the streets.  Some buildings also experienced electrical loss.    

    The quake comes one day after a 5.3 magnitude earthquake struck Colorado.  That quake reportedly caused only minor damage and no injuries.According to the US Geological Survey (GUSG), several million earthquakes occur annually but most are not realized because the majority of quakes are too small to be felt. Other significant earthquakes that struck the US this year include the 4.1 magnitude quakes that hit Northern California and Arkansas on January 8 and February 18 respectively.The largest recorded earthquake to hit the US was a magnitude 9.2 that stuck Prince William Sound, Alaska on March 28, 1964.  The largest recorded quake in the world was a magnitude 9.5 quake that occurred in Chile on May 22, 1960.On this day in 1985, a magnitude 7.5 quake hit China and resulted in at least 71 deaths and 162 injuries.  On this day in 1980, a magnitude quake in India took the lives of 15 and left 40 injured.Find and compare historic earthquakes on FindTheBest's Earthquakes Comparison and learn about the top 5 earthquakes with magnitudes of 9 and above, the top 5 earthquakes in terms of injuries and death counts, and the top 5 earthquakes in terms of damage done.SOURCE  FindTheBest.com    

Earthquakes in the nation’s capitol are as rare as hen’s teeth. The epicenter of Tuesday’s quake was in Mineral, Virginia, which is located on three very quiet fault lines. The occurrence of yet another freak earthquake in an unusual location is leading many anti-fracking activists (including me – they have just started fracking in Stratford, which is 40 minutes from New Plymouth) to wonder whether “fracking” in nearby West   Virginia may be responsible.

According to geologists, it isn’t the fracking itself that is linked to earthquakes, but the re-injection of waste salt water (as much as 3 million gallons per well) deep into rock beds.

Braxton County West Virginia (160 miles from Mineral) has experienced a rash of freak earthquakes (eight in 2010) since fracking operations started there several years ago. According to geologists fracking also caused an outbreak of thousands of minor earthquakes in Arkansas (as many as two dozen in a single day). It’s also linked to freak earthquakes in Texas, western New   York, Oklahoma, and Blackpool, England (which had never recorded an earthquake before).

Industry scientists deny the link to earthquakes, arguing that energy companies have been fracking for nearly sixty years. However it’s only a dozen years ago that “slick-water fracks” were introduced. This form of fracking uses huge amounts of water mixed with sand and dozens of toxic chemicals like benzene, all of which is injected under extreme pressure to shatter the underground rock reservoir and release gas trapped in the rock pores. Not only does the practice utilize millions of gallons of freshwater per frack (taken from lakes, rivers, or municipal water supplies), the toxic chemicals mixed in the water to make it “slick” endanger groundwater aquifers and threaten to pollute nearby water-wells.

I think it’s really hard to deny there’s a connection when the frequency of Arkansas earthquakes dropped by two-thirds when the Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission banned fracking (see http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/04/21/fracking-shutdown-earthquakes-arkansas_n_851930.html). Note that they didn’t stop entirely, which suggests that fault disruption may persist even after fracking stops.

Braxton County West Virginia also experienced a marked reduction in their quakes after the West Virginia Oil and Gas Commission forced fracking companies to cut back on the pressure and rate of salt water injection into the bedrock (see http://www.hurherald.com/cgi-bin/db_scripts/articles?Action=user_view&db=hurheral_articles&id=43334).

According to a joint study by Southern Methodist University and University of Texas-Austin, earthquakes started in the Dallas/Fort Worth region after a fracking disposal well there began operating in 2008 and stopped when it was closed in 2009 (see http://www.watershedsentinel.ca/content/does-gas-fracking-cause-earthquakes).

Blackpool, England banned fracking immediately, without waiting to see if more earthquakes would occur.

Meanwhile there is a legal precedent of an Arkansas man suing a fracking company for earthquake damage to his home. For people with earthquake damage from today’s quake, there’s a very nice lawyer at http://www.fracking-lawsuit.com/ who would be delighted to give you a free consultation.

Here in New Zealand, we worry about earthquakes a lot. There are a lot of people and businesses in Christchurch that can no longer get insurance because the Chch earthquakes practically wiped the insurance companies out.

Very interesting. I had not heard of the connection. A friend of mine-who is anti fracking and in the energy business -just mentioned that DC has had some historically bad earthquakes...I will pass this on to her.

Stuart:This is a well thought out post.I might interject that there is another cause of earthquakes which needs to be looked at also.Global warming.With billions of tons of ice on land melting and running into the sea an enormous amount of weight is shifted off of parts of tectonic plates. Those shifts would allow those plates to rise and cause plate movement throughout the globe, wouldn't they?Until you mention fracking I thought that the cause of the rash of earth quakes had only to do with ice melt plate release and movement. I would add your ideas to the mix.

I felt those earthquakes here in DFW. As a species we're not that smart.

I lived in Colorado years ago when fracking was going on and I remember the earthquakes. They stopped the fracking and the earthquakes stopped.

Tuning in a little late to your blog, "Dr. Stuart". [What name do you prefer being called by?].  Immensely appreciate your sharing your studies with us.  I'd been trying to find information via Google when I could have found it a good 24 hours ago from you! Godspeed to Christ Church (for which I have fond associations) from someone who moved from the Los Angeles major earthquake fault line to the Seattle one [after leaving next door to Elmira ;-)].  Much much appreciation for extending this important discussion.  THANK YOU! R

The science will tell us, which this blog does not.  More likely the erosion of the glaciers 20,000 years ago resulted in the geological happenstance that caused the 'quake. 'Facking' is to geology what an ice cube is to global warming.  Nice try.

(a) earthquakes do happen on their own(b) seems to be plenty evidence that fracking causes small local quakes(c) we gotta do something besides find, extract and burn all the possible fossil fuel there is(d) citizen initiatives are as likely to be FOR fracking and whatever-it-takes as for more sane policies...(e) having messed with the atmosphere and oceans, we're now messing with the deep earth!  My god, when will we stop?  Oh wait, I know the answer...

That is the first thing I thought of when I heard about the earthquake.If you are wondering about comments and ratings, it's working very poorly today. Thank you for writing this.

No. The earthquake epicenter was located in a seismically active part of Virginia known as the Central Virginia Seismic Zone. Although earthquakes of magnitude >5 are relatively rare in eastern North America, they do occur. The earthquake of August 23rd occurred exactly in an area where it was to be expected. It is doubtful that fracking injection would contribute enough fluid and energy needed to create the seismic activity necessary to generate a 5.8-5.9 magnitude earthquake that would be felt along a significant portion of North America.Please check the USGS website and examine the focal mechanism solution, which indicates reverse-oblique slipping along the nearby Spotsylvania Fault. Movement such as this is to be expected as a result of eastern North America existing in a compressional stress regime, possibly caused by subsidence of the adjacent Atlantic seafloor.The conjecture that the recent quake is the result of isostatic uplift caused by global warming can also be discounted in that the earthquake epicenter occurred well outside of (far south of) areas of observed post-glacial rebound.Global warming and hydrocarbon fracking pose serious threats to the environment and to life on Earth. The type of alarmism that some elements of the environmental movement use to further their own paranoid agendas is both unprofessional and deplorable, and serves no good to anyone. Please educate yourself more thoroughly on these issues, and seek the help of professionals who are knowledgeable in the field. I hope my comments have been of such help.Cheers.

Thanks for your comment, S. All I know is that Scott M. Ausbrooks, a RPG geologist from the Arkansas Geological Survey, believes there may be a connection with fracking and has gone to Virginia to investigate further. So this seems to be an area in which geologists are divided.If you are prepared to have an open mind about this, I suggest you check out the following links:http://planetsave.com/2011/02/18/arkansas-earthquakes-related-to-hydraulic-fracking/http://www.thesuntimes.com/news/x1704352837/Injection-wells-bannedhttp://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2011/jul/31/permanent-disposal-well-moratorium-issued-20110731/?news-arkansashttp://ozarksfirst.com/fulltext?nxd_id=510617

The nearest use of fracking is located 90 miles to the west of the epicenter, in West Virginia.  Even at a relatively high transport velocity of 1 ft/day- and assuming that groundwater flows in a straight line eastward from the fracking operation (which it doesn't) and that the intervening rock strata are perfectly homogenous (which they aren't)- it would take 475,200 days (~1,302 yrs) for injected fracking fluid to reach the known epicenter. This does not take into account the fact that time is needed for the fracking fluid to collect along the fault zone so as to lubricate the fault and allow for enhanced fault movement.  One must also explain the lack of smaller scale earthquakes that might be expected to have occurred west of the epicenter if fracking really is to blame. The real situation is far more complex than the simplification that I provided. As I stated in my previous comment, the earthquake occurred in a known seismic zone. In short, there is absolutely NO WAY that known fracking operations caused the recent Mineral, VA earthquake. While fracking operations are believed to cause small scale localized seismic disturbances, the recent Mineral, VA earthquake is an example of the infrequent large quakes that occur normally in eastern North America (e.g. Giles Co., VA, 1897; NY-Ontario, 1944, etc.). Also consider that the east coast appears to be overdue for a truly large quake such as the Charleston, SC quake of 1886 (mag. 7.3). Let us not forget the Cape Ann, MA quake of 1755 (mag. 5.9) which caused significant damage to the city of Boston. (Any ideas as to what caused those?)  There are plenty of reasons to want hydrocarbon fracking banned, but the recent earthquake of August 23 is NOT one of them. Let's keep an open mind.BTW, if it sounds as if I know what I'm talking about it's because I've worked as a hydrogeologist and environmental consultant since 1991, and I'm licensed in both NC and SC.

														5.9 Virginia Earthquake

														D.C. Earthquake

A 5.8 magnitude earthquake shook Virginia on Tuesday afternoon and folks quickly uploaded footage of their experience, and the quake's immediate aftermath, to YouTube.

The epicenter, which was located in Mineral, Va., fell between Richmond and Charlottesville, south of the nation's capital. According to the USGS, the quake occurred at a depth of 3.7 miles.

Richmond's close proximity to the epicenter allowed many to feel the quake strongly, though at this point there doesn't seem to have significant damage.

(UPDATED) 2 Nuclear Reactors Shut Down In Virginia Following M5.9 Earthquake | 

(UPDATED) 2 Nuclear Reactors Shut Down In Virginia Following M5.9 Earthquake

A nuclear power plant located in Louisa County, the epicenter of the earthquake in Virginia, has shut down. The North Anna Power  Station, operated by Dominion Power, has two reactors.  The plant  declared an "unusual event" in the wake of the 5.9 magnitude quake,  which is the lowest stage on the plant's emergency scale. As a result, the plant has been shut down. Check back with NBC Washington for more updates as they become available.(UPDATE)The AP reports the plant is being run off of four emergency diesel  generators, which are supplying power for critical safety equipment.(And what does the stock market do on the news? Bots go overdrive of course and ramp up the market. What else do they do? Sell gold and silver! Make sense, doesn't it? Time to buy risky assets (stocks) in times of uncertainty.)(Oh I see. Maybe when they evacuated the exchanges they instructed the bots to just keep buying stocks no matter what...)

Never mind what's happening with the reactors, how much spent fuel is in the spent fuel pool(s), and what's happening with them?According to this blog (see link below), which quotes from an email from Bob Alvarez:- North Anna reactors are Westinghouse PWRs, online since 1979-80- approx. 1,200 metric tons of spent fuel generated at North Anna in 32 years since then- the North Anna spent fuel contains approx. 228,000 curies of highly radioactive materials, which is said to be "among the largest concentrations of radioactivity" in the US.- approx. 40% North Anna spent fuel pool radioactivity is Cs-137 viz. "The North Anna pools hold about 15-30 times more Cs-137 than was released by the Chernobyl accident in 1986. - "In 2003, IPS helped lead a study warning that drainage of a pool might cause a catastrophic radiation fire, which could render an area uninhabitable greater than that created by the Chernobyl accident."- North Anna spent fuel pools "contain 4-5 times more than their original designs intended" viz. "As in Japan, all U.S. power nuclear power plant spent fuel pools do not have steel lined, concrete barriers that cover reactor vessels to prevent the escape of radioactivity. They are not required to have back-up generators to keep used fuel rods cool, if offsite power is lost. Even though they contain these very large amount of radioactivity, spent reactor fuel pools in the U.S. are mostly contained in ordinary industrial structures designed to protect them against the elements."http://pogoblog.typepad.com/pogo/2011/08/north-anna-nuclear-reactors-designed-to-withstand-59-61-magnitude-earthquake.htmlThis is, what, 80 miles from Washington DC?What the else will it take to shut this fucking industry down? Or are we finally done now?

Exploring Earthquake Risks to US Nuclear Power Pla...

 This is a guest post by Rebecca Anderson, ACE Sierra's Educator and Team Scientist This is weird. Today at 1:51 pm Eastern time a 5.9 magnitude earthquake struck northwest of Richmond, VA. It was felt as far north as New York City.

 Being a native East-coaster myself, I can tell you that we don’t get earthquakes in that part of the country. This means people, buildings and bridges are pretty unprepared for an event like this. Thankfully, I haven’t heard any reports of fatalities or serious injuries yet and hopefully that continues.

 But this earthquake has got me thinking. Earthquakes have nothing to do with climate change. We know this. Some quakes can strike out of the blue, like this one, in such a random place that there’s no way you could have predicted it. But other places, like along the San Andreas fault in California, you know that living there goes along with the risk of earthquakes. Scientists put a lot of work into calculating those risks and buildings and bridges are built accordingly.

 In this way, earthquakes give us a good analogy for dealing with climate change. The risks are understood and the precautions to minimize the risks are also known. You never know on a given day, even in California, if an earthquake is going to strike or not. Likewise, you never know when a big storm, flood or wildfire will hit. But, much like living along the San Andreas fault, with climate change we know that the chances of these events happening – flooding of the Mississippi, drought in Texas, wildfires in the southwest, this summer’s heat wave – are going up. As the venerable Stephen Schneider said, “We are loading the dice.”

 Here’s where we get to the difference. Earthquakes are caused by nothing less than seismic ruptures deep inside the Earth, set off by the forces of plate tectonics. There’s not a lot we can do about that. Climate change, on the other hand, we know we can do something about. The cause of this problem is us and that means the solution can be, is and will be u

 One of the coolest things I read about the earthquake is that people were getting tweets about it happening in DC just seconds before they actually felt the quake itself. That means with technology, we are faster even that those speedy P waves. Imagine what we’re capable of!

 We know it: Climate change is not an earthquake. It’s our mess, we made it and we gotta solve it. Thousands of young people across the country are heading back to school, rejoining their ACE Action Teams and getting to work.

Magnitude-5.8 quake rocks East Coast

Magnitude-5.8 quake rocks East Coast

A magnitude-5.8 quake centered in Virginia rocked the East Coast, with tremors felt as far south as North Carolina, as far north as Buffalo and Boston, and as far west as Detroit.Did you feel the tremors? Share your stories and photos with our reporters at debrown@usatoday.com.Update at 7:36 p.m. ET: Think all earthquake-jaded Left Coasters are laughing at Right Coasters' jitters?"Well, Easterners, don't believe it. When it comes to quakes, no one gets used to them, especially not when they're in the magnitude 5.0-plus range," a Los Angeles Times writer confesses."The truth is, what most of us on the West Coast were thinking is, Thank God it wasn't us this time."Read the rest here, Eastern quake veterans.Update at 7:11 p.m. ET: Readers from up and down the Eastern Seaboard and Canada have been sharing their quake experiences, and USA TODAY's reader advocate, Desair Brown, has complied some of the many e-mails she has received. Here are a few:Atlanta, Ga.One of my team members came over to me and asked me if I felt the building shake a moment ago? I told her no I hadn't and that it must be an A/C unit going on. Then another employee approached both of us and asked if we felt the building move. Again, I said I hadn't because I was walking around and perhaps didn't catch the movement. By the time we finished talking, my entire staff was in the bullpen area talking about the entire building shaking and that it couldn't have been an A/C unit. I went online to the Georgia Tech web site for seismic activity and sure enough, there was activity on the waveform!Kurt BlumthalBirmingham, Mich.Just before 2 p.m. today, I was in my car at an ATM machine and I felt my car shake. I'd never felt that sort of sensation before and was upset, because it's a new car and I was worried that something was wrong with the engine. I even looked at the dashboard to see if the engine had a warning signal that it might be overheating. It lasted less than a minute - maybe 30 seconds - and then it stopped.Terry MatlenWest Mifflin, Pa.The couch on which I was sitting shook for about 10 seconds. I thought, "Must have the house checked for termites." Fifteen minutes later a friend called from D.C., about the quake. I told him I had felt it and asked if P.A. had been mentioned. He said "No, call it in to CNN." I did.  But, I only said I was calling from P.A. So, now the news says it was felt in Philadelphia!Julia MooreLouisa, Va.Dishes shattered on our kitchen floor and things fell from the shelves. The house is in total disarray. I stood on my front porch with another woman who was home alone, and the ground shook once more. Apparently a 2.8 aftershock took place about an hour after the initial quake took place. It shook our homes again. It's 5:10 p.m. now, about three hours after and Louisa, Va., still has rumblings from beneath the ground.Jackie ClarkBrooklyn, N.Y.I was attending a GoToMeeting from a conference room in my office at Sunset Park, Brooklyn, N.Y., led by our vendor located in Virginia Beach. She felt it first, of course, telling us her house was shaking and we all said how weird. Within literally not more than a minute, we started shaking, too. The conference call dropped, and we deliberated climbing under the table when the fire alarm system instructed us to evacuate. Fortunately, everyone is fine, with the possible exception of our vendor's AC unit.Toby NemiroffToronto, CanadaWhile my boss was on an important call the phone cut out. When he called back the person on the other line, near Washington, D.C., had informed us that there had just been an earthquake. Not even 60 seconds later as I was sitting at my desk, I started to feel very dizzy and queasy, like I might faint, when I looked over to see the juice in my clear cup swaying quite significantly back and forth. I turned to my coworkers and asked if they felt what it was, and sure enough we all thought we were crazy.Molly MacDonaldRaleigh, N.C.I thought my son Ryan was rolling the barbecue grill around the back porch for some reason. But then it increased and I thought, "WHAT is that young man DOING?!?" Next, small glass objects in a cabinet started to rattle and I thought "Could this ACTUALLY be an earthquake?" Then my son ran into the room and I KNEW it wasn't him.Dan FinchColumbus, Ind.I was sitting at my desk in Columbus, Ind., when I began swaying slightly back and forth in my chair. I did not think much of it until other in the office started noticing it as well. It lasted about 30-45 seconds. You could actually feel the floor shaking slightly as well. Not bad enough to cause any damage though.Phil LeahighUpdate at 6:48 p.m. ET: USA TODAY's Marisol Bello is at the epicenter of today's quake, Mineral, Va.,  and reports isolated damage to some homes, businesses and cars hit by falling bricks.She is at the local fire house and rescue squad, where residents have gathered to make sandwiches for firefighters or other residents who may be displaced."I thought it was a runaway train," said Marilyn Gutekenst, 59, a substitute teacher and chaplain for the rescue squad who was clearing dishes on her back desk after a lunch with friends. "I thought, 'I don't belong here. I need to move quickly.' "She said she ran inside her home --near the train tracks -- to see picture frames falling off the wall, plates breaking and bookcases toppling. The house looked structurally OK, however, so she and her husband, Albert, 65, a retired second lieutenant with the rescue squad, headed to the firehouse to help.Update at 6:36 p.m. ET: The New York Times notes that after the Capitol was evacuated, the Senate held an unusual, 22-second session in a basement conference room in the nearby Postal Square Building, one structure designated for use in an emergency.The Times writes that the session "essentially served as a dry run for procedures put in place after the Sept. 11 attacks."Details here.Update at 6:28 p.m. ET: The quake snapped a water pipe and flooded parts of two floors of the world's largest office building, otherwise known as the Pentagon, USA TODAY's Tom Vanden Brook reports. The building was partially evacuated and workers were allowed back in after Pentagon officials gave the all-clear.Update at 6:11 p.m. ET: USA TODAY's Kitty Bean Yancey has more about the Washington Monument's alleged tilt.Update at 5:46 p.m. ET: The U.S. Park Police have shot down a Fox News report that the Washington Monument was leaning as a result of the earthquake, TPM says.Here's how The Washington Times reported the Fox report:Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly reported at 2:30 p.m. ET their bureau received information from a producer saying that a Captiol Hill Police officer was saying the Washington Monument may actually be tilting as a result of the earthquake.Seismologist John Rundle joined Kelly on her show and confirmed that the Washington Monument could very well be tilting as a result of the earthquake and the structure should be checked out.There are, however, conflicting reports at the moment about whether the monument suffered any damage. A Park Service spokesman told the Associated Press there was "absolutely no damage" to the Washington Monument, Lincoln Memorial or other tourist destinations along the Mall.CNN later reported the quake had loosened some stones.Here's an earlier CNN roundup of damage reports.Update at 5:35 p.m. ET: Virginia Primary voting continues, USA TODAY's Carly Mallenbaum reports. The longest polling place closure was 30 minutes, which "was rare," according to a tweet from the Virginia State Board of Elections.Update at 5:28 p.m. ET: USA TODAY's Jeff Stinson has a look at what's been happening with some transportation:About 390 flights to or from New York City's JFK, Reagan National, Washington Dulles and New Jersey's Newark Liberty were delayed at least 30 minutes, five times more than usual, said Daniel Baker, chief executive officer of Houston-based data tracker FlightAware.com told Bloomberg News.Passenger terminals at Reagan National and Dulles remained open, with "no major damage that I'm aware of," Tara Hamilton, a spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority. And the FAA reported no air traffic control outages. The national passenger rail service Amtrak reported that it slowed the speed of trains between Baltimore and Washington following the quake.The quake snarled traffic in the nation's capital and delayed flights along the East Coast.Many traffic lights were knocked out in Washington, and the Washington Area Metropolitan Transit Authority ordered all subway and surface trains to reduce their speed to 15 mph until inspectors could check rails, which slowed the evening commute for many. More than 700,000 riders use Metro trains most workdays, although August is a slower month. The authority said buses on all major routes suffered delays in the late afternoon because many traffic signals were out and traffic was clogged.New York's MTA reported no major incidents or delays on subways or rails.Update at 4:44 p.m. ET: The National Cathedral in northwest Washington sustained "significant damage," with capstones tumbling off three of the four spires on the central tower, a spokesman tells USA TODAY's Brad Heath.Spokesman Richard Weinberg said the cathedral's tower is the highest point in Washington. Other stones shaken loose by the quake tumbled onto the grass outside.There were about 200 people inside the cathedral at the time, Weinberg said. None was injured. He said that repairing the spires and other damage will "definitely involve a lot of work" but that the extent of the damage would not be known until the cathedral's stonemasons and engineers finished assessing the building. It remained closed this afternoon.Update at 4:35 p.m. ET: The Federal Emergency Management Agency reports cellphone network "congestion" and asks people to use text or e-mail in the next few hours, except in emergencies.Here are tips for what to do before and during a quake.Update at 4:13 p.m. ET: USA TODAY's Gregory Korte reports some facts from seismological data shared with the USGS:It registered, in varying degrees of intensity, as far west as St. Louis, Mo., as far south as Montgomery, Ala., and as far north as Easton, Maine.Update at 4:05 p.m. ET: The U.S. Geological Survey has lowered the quake's magnitude to 5.8 from 5.9.The quake was quite shallow, rupturing at a depth of about 3.7 miles, with a variation of +/- 1.6 miles.By Douglas StanglinUSA TODAYUpdate at 3:36 p.m. ET: LaGuardia and JFK airports, which were shut down after the quake, have resumed service, MSNBC reports. The passenger rail service Amtrak reports that it is reducing the speed of trains between Baltimore and Washington after the quake.Update at 3:28 p.m. ET: USA TODAY's Kevin Johnson, reporting from downtown Washington, says the quake knocked out traffic lights downtown, snarling traffic as fire trucks and other emergency vehicles -- sirens blaring -- snaked through the confusion. The sidewalks teemed with anxious office workers who fled or were ordered to leave their buildings.At the Grand Hyatt Hotel, uniformed cooks, waiters, barristas and room maids poured onto 10th Street. Many of them had cellphones pressed to their ears and looked skyward as if concerned about the integrity of the hotel towering above. "I thought I was fainting or something with the ground moving like it was,'' said bellman Ted Mesfin, 54. "Flatscreen TVs and dressers were shaking in the (guest) rooms. People thought the whole building was coming down.''Update at 3:21 p.m. ET: Federal officials say two nuclear reactors at the North Anna Power Station in Louisa County, Va., near the epicenter of the quake, were automatically taken off line by safety systems around the time it struck, the Associated Press reports.The Dominion-operated power plant is being run off of four emergency diesel generators, which supply power for critical safety equipment.Nuclear Regulatory Commission spokesman Roger Hannah says the agency was not immediately aware of any damage at nuclear power plants in the Southeast. The NRC and Dominion are sending people to inspect the site.LIVE:  Washington area coverage from WUSAUpdate at 3:13 p.m. ET: Alesha Williams Boyd of the Asbury Park Press, took some soundings of people's reaction in her area and got this reaction: "I thought a cat was under my recliner," says Pat Dolan of Lakewood, N.J. "My chair was moving." The feeling was so odd Dolan woke her brother, who'd felt nothing and "thought I was crazy," Dolan says. "I insisted my chair was rocking side to side," Dolan said. "I thought it was cool but spooky."Update at 3:08 p.m. ET: USA TODAY's Kevin McCoy, who was covering the Dominique Strauss-Kahn hearing in New York, says the quake hit just as Manhattan DA Cyrus Vance Jr. was starting a news conference. Police and court officers immediately evacuated the building.Sonia Spence, a data transcriber for the U.S. Department of Citizenship and Immigration Services, says she had just returned to her desk on the fourth floor of 26 Federal Plaza when the building began to sway. "I thought, 'What could be shaking the building like this?' My first thought was a terrorist." Spence, a legally blind Bronx resident, said she dropped her purse which contained her cellphone, hurrying downstairs and outside.Update at 3:06 p.m. ET: USA TODAY's Melanie Eversley reports that organizers for Sunday's planned dedication on the National Mall for the Martin Luther King Jr. National Memorial say the National Park Service is performing required safety checks and is monitoring the situation. They say nothing on the site has been disturbed.Update at 3:04 p.m. ET: The State Department building in the Foggy Bottom area of Washington has been evacuated, public affairs specialist Urenia Young says in an e-mail. "We are out of the building," she writesUpdate at 3:01 p.m. ET:USA TODAY's Dan Vergano sent us this file:"Central Virginia does get its share of minor earthquakes, but an earthquake of this size on the East Coast is certainly very unusual," says seismologist Karen Fischer of Brown University.Virginia is not on an active earthquake fault and is roughly in the middle of the North American continental crustal plate, she says. But it has residual fault scars left over from 200 million to 300 million years ago, when it was an earthquake zone, at the time when the Atlantic Ocean rifted apart from Europe. "We are just seeing pressure build up and release on those scars," Fischer says. "There is a lot of debate on exactly what is going on down there and exactly how quakes this big happen in this kind of crustal zone."Because the crust under the East Coast is colder and firmer than the West Coast, shocks travel more efficiently through it, accounting for the widely felt shaking."One lesson of this quake is that building codes will likely need to be revisited on the East Coast," Fischer says. "Because we are not as conscious of earthquakes here as the West Coast, and we will have to see about structural damage to buildings, although I have not heard any damage reports so far."Update at 2:53 p.m. ET: MSNBC reports that the quake has caused flight delays at a number of airports, including JFK, Newark, Washington National, Washington Dulles and Philadelphia.Update at 2:51 p.m. ET: Verizon Wireless and AT&T say their networks were congested as the quake sent people scrambling for the phones, the Associated Press reports.Verizon Wireless spokesman Tom Pica says there has been no damage to the company's equipment. He says the crush of phone calls made it hard for some customers to get through for about 20 minutes after the quake. That has since began to clear, he says. Sprint says some customers may experience delays.Update at 2:48 p.m. ET: Halley Pack, 24, a paralegal, was putting on her sneakers in the basement-level gym of her office building in downtown Washington when the shaking started. She said she didn't realize that it was an earthquake at first, USA TODAY's Fredreka Schouten reports. "I've never been in an earthquake before," she said, standing in her exercise clothes outside her office building at 2:20 p.m. "I thought something was wrong with me, like I had a headache."Outside, dozens of office workers milled about, comparing notes and trying to reach friends and family members on their mobile phones.Pack's colleague Caitlin Shea, 22, said she was at her desk when the earthquake struck. "The filing cabinets started shaking. I thought they would topple on us."She was nervous about re-entering the 12-story building where they work. "I'm afraid of aftershocks," she said.Update at 2:40 p.m. ET: USA TODAY's Dan Vergano reports that the quake, described as medium-sized, could be felt as far north as Ottawa, Canada. In New York, the Holland Tunnel closed, forcing drivers to back out into Manhattan. In Washington, numerous public buildings were evacuated, including the Pentagon, the Capitol and the Homeland Security Department, as well as all monuments and malls.Update at 2:36 p.m. ET: The Associated Press quotes the U.S. Weather Service as saying no tsunami is expected after the quake.Update at 2:30 p.m. ET: The Washington Post quotes a USGS official as saying, "We would certainly expect aftershocks."Update at 2:29 p.m. ET: The USGS suggests that the quake is the largest to originate in Virginia since May 31, 1897.Update at 2:26 p.m. ET: The USGS says the quake was centered at a depth of 4.6 miles.Update at 2:18 p.m. ET: In "the East Coast you have this old hard, cold crust that does a lovely job of transmitting the waves," says Lucy Jones, a seismologist with the U.S. Geological Survey. "This large of an earthquake ... could definitely have been felt hundreds of miles away."Update at 2:16 p.m. ET: Fox News reports that JFK airport has been shut down because of the quake.Update at 2:15 p.m. ET: "It scared the heck out of me, I'm still shaking," said Joan Morris, spokeswoman for the northern district of the Virginia Department of Transportation. A few minutes after the quake, there were no reports of damage to roads or bridges in the state, Morris said.Update at 2:13 p.m. ET: The USGS puts the magnitude of the quake at 5.9.Update at 2:12 p.m. ET: The quake could be felt in McLean, Va., headquarters of USA TODAY. It caused the building to sway. Some items could be heard falling from shelves. A number of employees left the building.Update at 2:10 p.m. ET: NBC reports that the quake was centered 9 miles from Mineral, Va., which is 100 miles south of Washington.Doug Kammerer, meteorologist with the NBC affiliate in Washington, calls the tremor a "very big earthquake for our area."The quake struck around 1:52 p.m. ET and lasted for about 30 to 45 seconds.There have been no reports of injuries or widespread damage.Update at 2 p.m. ET: Reuters reports an earthquake centered near Mineral, Va., rocked the Mid-Atlantic states and was felt as far north at Manhattan and as far south as North Carolina.Update at 1:57 p.m. ET: The Associated Press reports that the Pentagon is being evacuated.Fox News reports that several public buildings, including the Capitol, have been evacuated.

One of the most classic “California” words used by young and old is …totally.  I had to chuckle when I saw the announcement this morning that the California Emergency Management Agency has partnered with the California Seismic Safety Commission (CSSC) and California Earthquake Authority (CEA) to launch “Totally Unprepared” just in time for National Preparedness Month!   This totally California multimedia campaign is geared to help Californians (actually anyone!) better understand their risk of earthquakes and how to prepare for them.

Today the first in a series of videos showing Californians taking simple steps to keep themselves safe in the event of an earthquake.  The first video features former NFL star Vencie Glenn as he admits he wasn’t prepared and actually suffered damages from a recent earthquake.  The best part is that he learns what to do to safely secure his home and safeguard his property from damages.

Did the earth move for you yesterday?!? For a lot of people in the East it did! Virginia’s BIG 5.8 earthquake…widespread ground shaking

Comparing two similar quakes in two different parts of the United States...significant difference in how far away the ground shaking is felt. (Source New York Times)

Earthquakes in the central and eastern U.S., although less frequent than in the western U.S., are typically felt over a much broader region. East of the Rockies, an earthquake can be felt over an area as much as ten times larger than a similar magnitude earthquake on the west coast. A magnitude 4.0 eastern U.S. earthquake typically can be felt at many places as far as 100 km (60 mi) from where it occurred, and it infrequently causes damage near its source. A magnitude 5.5 eastern U.S. earthquake usually can be felt as far as 500 km (300 mi) from where it occurred, and sometimes causes damage as far away as 40 km (25 mi).

Yesterday’s earthquake occurred on a north or northeast-striking plane within a previously recognized seismic zone, called the “Central Virginia Seismic Zone” (CVSZ).  The CVSZ has produced small and moderate earthquakes since at least the 18th century. The previous largest historical shock from the CVSZ occurred in 1875 and occurred before the invention of effective seismographs, but the felt area of the shock suggests that it had a magnitude of about 4.8. The 1875 earthquake shook bricks from chimneys, broke plaster and windows, and overturned furniture at several locations. A magnitude 4.5 earthquake, December 9, 2003 also produced minor damage.

For those of you in the East and Midwest this is a bit of a wake up call.  Earthquakes happen throughout the United States, albeit more commonly in the West.  Take a look at your emergency response and business continuity plans this morning through fresh, earthquake filled eyes.

Oh, and by the way, the largest natural earthquake in Colorado in more than a century struck Monday night in the state’s southeast corner, but there were no reports of damage or injuries. The quake, with a preliminary magnitude of 5.3, was centered about nine miles from the city of Trinidad and hit at 11:46 p.m. local time. It was felt as far away as Greeley, about 350 miles north, and into Kansas and New Mexico.

Can earthquakes be predicted? Long held belief is no, but a Bay Area project, QuakeFinder, is trying to prove the naysayers wrong.

Reading the New York Times this weekend, I came upon an article about a Bay Area company trying to predict earthquakes.  Well, that requires a little data mining to find out what they are all about…

The company, Stellar Solutions has a project called QuakeFinders which involves installing 200 five-foot-tall sensors near fault lines to measure changes in underground magnetic fields and detect electrically charged particles in the air. The theory behind it is that changes in electromagnetic fields can foretell quakes.  Now isn’t that interesting!?!?!

So why do geological scientists like U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) think about this idea?!? Well it turns out, that the science behind QuakeFinder is disputed. It appears that most seismologists dismiss it as a sham and that forecasting earthquakes is impossible. USGS, the main sponsor of most earthquake research, does not support quake-related studies of electromagnetic radiation because it has found them to be a scientific dead end.

As you might suspect, QuakeFinder has other thoughts.  As reported by the company, QuakeFinder devices detected electromagnetic pulses that resembled those produced by lightning in the two weeks before an earthquake struck at Alum Rock near San Jose in 2007, he said, and charged air particles and infrared light were also detected. Similar observations by QuakeFinder preceded an earthquake in Peru last year.

QuakeFinder is the world’s leading private research organization focused on creating a system for forecasting major earthquakes. Operating as a humanitarian R&D division of Stellar Solutions and funded by Stellar Solutions, by grants from NASA, subscriptions, and sponsorships from the public, QuakeFinder has developed the science, technology, infrastructure and expertise that are the foundation for a practical earthquake forecasting solution.

The One, Two Punch…first then earthquake and the Irene…what sources did you use to track the… http://t.co/I98T9aF 1 week ago

August 22, 2011. The sounds were captured by 2 hikers earlier in the day before the Colorado Earthquake. Does this have any link to the Virginia earthquake and Comet Elenin alignments?

Is it possible that in using HAARP to try to steer hurricane Irene away from the eastern seaboard and minimize the potential for widespread catastrophic damage from what meteorologists say could come ashore as a monster category 4 hurricane—is it possible that the Virginia earthquake was accidentally induced? Extensive information available to the public implies the answer is yes.

As far as the Virginia earthquake being a product of HAARP, please learn more about this technology, and decide for yourself. There is great possibility that HAARP has already affected all of our lives in ways that seem incredible.

The “once in 500 year” flooding of the Mississippi river over the New Madrid fault line is part of a campaign directed against the American people, according to multiple intelligence agency (MI6, CIA, FSB, Japan Security police) sources. The HAARP caused flooding is expected to be followed by an earthquake and then a “nuclear emergency” involving the 15 nuclear reactors located in the region. This will be a pretext for mass evacuations into FEMA camps, the sources say. The best way to derail this plan, apart from arresting the criminal cabal in Washington D.C., is to widely announce and denounce these plans in advance. Read article here

The horrific earthquake weapon attack on Japan, resulting in 10 meter tsunamis along much of Japan’s coast line came from rogue elements of the U.S. government located in underground bases in New Mexico and Nevada, according to pentagon and CIA sources.  Read articles here and here and a video explanation here

Satanists who have participated in the plot to enslave humanity are worried and are starting to run. With 40% of Greece’s population revolting, the satanists are realizing we have great strength in unity. The masses are becoming aware and revolution is coming. Their plan was to kill at least 4 billion people and permanently enslave the rest of humanity. There is so much evidence for this now that only the fools still relying on Satanic corporate propaganda do not realize it yet. The plan involved a fake alien invasion, germ warfare, starvation, atomic war and artificially generated disasters like tsunamis and earthquakes. Read Article Here

The US government, using a secret military program HAARP (High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program) has been altering the climate, and using high power microwave energy inducing earthquakes including the Asian Tsunami (2004) and earthquakes in Japan (1995), China (2008), Haiti (2010), Chile (2010). 

08.29 Was the Virginia Earthquake Induced by HAARP 

A relatively rare East Coast earthquake centered in Virginia shook people from Canada to Georgia. Carnegie Institute of Washington geophysicist Diana Roman explains the geology of the region, and the factors that allowed the earthquake's seismic waves to travel far and wide. 

Copyright © 2011 National Public Radio®. For personal, noncommercial use only. See Terms of Use. For other uses, prior permission required. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)  FLATOW: Up next, the quake. If you live on the East Coast, chances are you felt the earth move under your feet earlier this week. An historic 5.8 magnitude quake struck this side of the U.S. on Tuesday. The quake was centered in Virginia, but people reported feeling it as far north as Canada and all the way down into Georgia. Big quakes in this part of the country not at all uncommon. And last time, a quake hit this close to something this size in the area was 1875.  But when quakes do hit the East Coast, more people are feeling them over a wider area. Why is that? Well, here to answer some of those questions is Diana C. Roman. She is a geophysicist and a staff scientist in the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism at the Carnegie Institute in Washington. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Dr. Roman.  Dr. DIANA C. ROMAN: Thank you.  FLATOW: We keep hearing that the reason why people felt this quake widespread because it was on a single plate, is that right?  ROMAN: Well, it's  it's what's known as an intraplate earthquake, meaning that it's an earthquake that happened very far away from one of the Earth's major tectonic plate boundaries. So here on the East Coast, we're not on a plate boundary. We're, in fact, very far away from the nearest plate boundary. And so that makes this earthquake somewhat unique, and that's also why it was somewhat surprising. We tend to feel earthquakes, more commonly, closer to plate boundaries.  FLATOW: So we're not on a fault line that's on a plate boundary. It's just the plate shaking of its own, nothing bumping into it, sliding under it, anything like that?  ROMAN: Well, you basically need two things for an earthquake. You need a plane of weakness, and that could be something like a fault embedded in the rock, and then, you need force on that plane to drive that sudden release of energy. And here on the East Coast, we do have faults in the rock that are left over from previous cycles of tectonic activity a long time ago. So millions of years ago, the East Coast was very much like the current West Coast in that it was the site of an active plate boundary. And so we do have faults left over from that time, that if they're under sufficient stress can slip and produce earthquakes, like the one we felt last Tuesday.  FLATOW: This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR. I'm Ira Flatow talking with Dr. Diana C. Roman, a geophysicist. We're talking about the earthquake earlier that most of us felt. And would it be true to say that these are happening all the time, of this magnitude or little less, and this is just one that we happen to feel?  ROMAN: They are happening, certainly not of this magnitude, but there have been reports of smaller earthquakes on the East Coast in recent years. And also, historically, there have been large-magnitude earthquakes on the East Coast. Most recently, actually, in the Gulf of Mexico in 2006, there was a magnitude seven that was felt along the west coast of Florida. Further back in history, some very famous events, the 1883 earthquake in Charleston, South Carolina, was a 7.1, and that did actually quite a lot of damage and resulted in a number of fatalities.  So the large events are rare, as they are everywhere on Earth. The bigger the earthquake, the less frequently it occurs. And that's the same on the East Coast, but they're even more rare here. But we do also have small earthquakes occurring occasionally that we detect with seismic instrumentation on the East Coast, as well as on the West Coast.  FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number. You know, something that to my own personal view is really astounding, is that I remember back in 1985 we had an earthquake that I felt in - well, living in Connecticut, and we had a hurricane that same year...  (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)  FLATOW: ...off the coast.  ROMAN: It's history repeating itself.  FLATOW: How rare is this?  (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)  FLATOW: Again, right, do you remember the '85 quake?  ROMAN: I don't.  FLATOW: Or do you know about it?  ROMAN: I actually was - I was living in California then. So I was dealing with our own local seismicity, but that's an amazing coincidence. And certainly, you know, I think this week's earthquake and the hurricane that's now headed towards the East Coast are not related. So it's one of those funny coincidences.  FLATOW: Let me get a quick call in from Abu(ph) in Charlottesville. Hi. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  ABU: Hello. How are you doing, Neal?  FLATOW: Hi there. This is Ira today. Go ahead.  ABU: Oh. Hi. How are you? I live in Charlottesville. I'm a little concerned because we are - I think this is the fourth aftershock since then and I work in the hospitals. And most of the time - in fact, one of these events was (unintelligible) all of a sudden (unintelligible) feeling the same tremor. I want to know exactly how long this is going to last, because just two nights ago I was laying in the bed, almost 1:30 in the morning, and I felt another one.  FLATOW: All right. Let me get - I have to cut you off because we're running out of time. Dr. Roman, any response on how long this will last?  ROMAN: Well, first of all, aftershocks are normal after earthquakes, and there was a fairly significant aftershock the other night at one in the morning that many people did feel. That was a magnitude 4.5. There have been a couple twos and threes as well. And the aftershocks are going to become less frequent as we get further and further away from Tuesday's earthquake. So you may still feel them, but they'll become...  FLATOW: All right.  ROMAN: ...less frequent as we move on.  FLATOW: Stay with us. We'll be right back with more questions for Dr. Roman. I'm Ira Flatow. This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR.  (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)  FLATOW: You're listening to SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking with Diana C. Roman. She's a geophysicist and staff scientist in the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism - whoo - at the Carnegie Institute of Washington - in Washington, D.C. Our number, 1-800-989-8255. You know, we always talk about budget cuts and things like this to research, basic research and especially what goes on with atmospheric and geomagnetic kinds of research. Do you think this quake is going to change possibly some priorities in Washington because it hit home, so to speak?  ROMAN: Well, possibly. And I mean, if there's an upside to Tuesday's quake, that it was big enough to get people's attention and remind everybody that, you know, earthquakes do happen, and we need to continue to study earthquakes on the East Coast. But, you know, it didn't do a huge amount of damage. I know that's no comfort to people who were, you know, planning to visit the King memorial. But, you know, relatively speaking, this wasn't a damaging earthquake. So, hopefully, this will raise awareness and help increase funding to study intraplate earthquakes.  FLATOW: Chris in Salt Lake. Hi. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  CHRIS: Hi, Ira.  FLATOW: Hi there. Go ahead.  CHRIS: I was hoping to ask your guest about connections between earthquakes and fracking. I do know that fracking is literally creating fault lines in the ground and creating large spaces where the earth could move into. Earlier this week in Colorado, there was an unusual earthquake in the center of a lot of fracking activity. And I was hoping you two could talk about that for me. Thanks. I'll take my answer off the air.  FLATOW: Thank you. Yeah. We had other inquires about this. Is there any connection, Dr. Roman?  ROMAN: Well, fracking is a somewhat controversial process that is used to extract natural gases from the earth. Basically, it's done by pumping fluids into the ground to break up the rock and make it easier to get into all the little pockets of natural gas that are isolated, to help push them out. It does produce earthquakes. Most of the time, those are very small earthquakes, but occasionally, they are felt earthquakes. Recently, there was a swarm in Arkansas - felt earthquakes.  Also several decades ago in Colorado, there was some deep pumping that produced several sizable earthquakes. And this why fracking is controversial, because we don't know about the possibility of the fracking process to trigger a large earthquake. We tend to associate it with small earthquakes, but it is possible that, under the right conditions, we might get a larger earthquake.  FLATOW: Is anybody studying that possible relationship?  ROMAN: Yes. Of course, this is something that's definitely being studied and certainly...  FLATOW: By whom?  ROMAN: By seismologists, such as myself, both in academia and also within the oil and natural gas industry.  FLATOW: Well, because we'd like to - I'm glad to hear you're doing it because you're an independent researcher.  ROMAN: It is a process and a phenomenon that is certainly being discussed in light of some of the recent observations of seismicity related to fracking.  FLATOW: When you say there was a moderate or - what size are we talking about - a frack-related quake?  ROMAN: Well, most of the seismicity that's associated with fluid pumping into the ground is really small, magnitude three or less, and that's below the threshold of what you would be likely to feel. But there have been fours, fives that are thought to have been related to pumping of fluids underground, although, again, that's rarer than the smaller events, but it is possible.  FLATOW: And with the increase with fracking going around the country, we might see more of those events.  ROMAN: It is possible. Yes.  FLATOW: Yeah. And something that you're working on.  ROMAN: Mm-hmm.  FLATOW: Wow. And what would you - if you had - I'm going to give you the blank-check questions sometimes I give to scientists. If you had an unlimited amount of money you wanted to sink into your research, what would you like to study?  ROMAN: Oh. Well, actually, one of my main interests is the relationship between earthquakes and volcanic activity, and that's something where we always need more instruments and more money to get out to the places that we're interested in and put out our instruments. But I think in general, you know, the way we move forward in understanding natural processes is by getting more observations. And so really having more seismometers, having more computational power to process data is really what's going to help us understand some of these things and move our ability to explain and, ideally, forecast these events forward.  FLATOW: And hardware is usually the first that gets cut, though, in budgets.  ROMAN: It is, but, you know, it's - science is expensive, and that's the reality. You know, it's not only the instruments themselves but also the transportation, the labor, the maintenance and so on. So science is simply, by its nature, an expensive field, but that's what it takes if we do want to solve the problems that result from natural phenomena like earthquakes.  FLATOW: All right. Thank you very much. Very eloquent today. Nice to have a guest who is - can speak so well.  ROMAN: Oh, thank you.   FLATOW: You're very eloquent. Doctor Diana C. Roman, a geophysicist and staff scientist in the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism at Carnegie Institution of Washington in Washington, D.C. Yeah. Thanks. Have a safe weekend.   ROMAN: Thank you. My pleasure.   FLATOW: Tie down that lawn furniture.  Copyright © 2011 National Public Radio®. All rights reserved.

 Rare Earthquake Rocks Eastern Seaboard Aug. 24, 2011

Exploring Earthquake Risks to US Nuclear Power Pla...

 This is a guest post by Rebecca Anderson, ACE Sierra's Educator and Team Scientist This is weird. Today at 1:51 pm Eastern time a 5.9 magnitude earthquake struck northwest of Richmond, VA. It was felt as far north as New York City.

 Being a native East-coaster myself, I can tell you that we don’t get earthquakes in that part of the country. This means people, buildings and bridges are pretty unprepared for an event like this. Thankfully, I haven’t heard any reports of fatalities or serious injuries yet and hopefully that continues.

 But this earthquake has got me thinking. Earthquakes have nothing to do with climate change. We know this. Some quakes can strike out of the blue, like this one, in such a random place that there’s no way you could have predicted it. But other places, like along the San Andreas fault in California, you know that living there goes along with the risk of earthquakes. Scientists put a lot of work into calculating those risks and buildings and bridges are built accordingly.

 In this way, earthquakes give us a good analogy for dealing with climate change. The risks are understood and the precautions to minimize the risks are also known. You never know on a given day, even in California, if an earthquake is going to strike or not. Likewise, you never know when a big storm, flood or wildfire will hit. But, much like living along the San Andreas fault, with climate change we know that the chances of these events happening – flooding of the Mississippi, drought in Texas, wildfires in the southwest, this summer’s heat wave – are going up. As the venerable Stephen Schneider said, “We are loading the dice.”

 Here’s where we get to the difference. Earthquakes are caused by nothing less than seismic ruptures deep inside the Earth, set off by the forces of plate tectonics. There’s not a lot we can do about that. Climate change, on the other hand, we know we can do something about. The cause of this problem is us and that means the solution can be, is and will be u

 One of the coolest things I read about the earthquake is that people were getting tweets about it happening in DC just seconds before they actually felt the quake itself. That means with technology, we are faster even that those speedy P waves. Imagine what we’re capable of!

 We know it: Climate change is not an earthquake. It’s our mess, we made it and we gotta solve it. Thousands of young people across the country are heading back to school, rejoining their ACE Action Teams and getting to work.

Potres pregled : A very strong 5.8 earthquake has rattled the Virginia area at 1:51 PM local time.

Read also :  Video selection of the Virginia earthquake by Earthquake-Report.com

Watch also : Earthquake-Report.com has made a short video telling and explaining what happened. The video is embedded below or click here to watch it.

- This is a major disruption earthquake due to the low earthquake risk perception, with relatively minor consequences.

Earthquake-Report.com has labeled this earthquake as CATDAT ORANGE, not for the level  of structural damage, but due to the economic impact.

Louisa County, VA -   I was inside one of the seriously damaged schools when the earthquake  hit- debris was falling, very difficult to walk. Terrifying, horrifying  ordeal, but all children and staff escaped quickly and without a  scratch.  A miracle!  It lasted about 30 sekundi, and was followed by 3  aftershocks.  What I will probably always remember are the shepherd’s  hooks in the sidewalk that kept swaying, even after the noise and  vibration were no longer detectable.  I don’t need to experience another  one of these.  Ever. – MMI VII

Ažuriranje : This video is from CBS6 in Richmond, Virdžinija, closest big city to the earthquakes epicenter. 

Ažuriranje :  Based on what we have seen so far and also based on our experience in the field, we do not think that the damage will be severe and we hope to hear soon that no people will have been injured by this earthquake.

Ažuriranje : Generally we can state that the situation is quiet chaotic over the many states that have felt the earthquake. Most of the states outside the greater epicenter area have only experienced a weak shaking, nothing really dangerous, but we agree very frightening.

Ažuriranje : 2 Nuclear reactors have been halted after the Virginia quake. The Nuclear reactors at the North Anna Power Station in Louisa County are rather close to the epicenter. the Power plants were automatically taken off-line by the plants safety systems.  The NRC is sending inspectors to the plant to find out whether everything is OK. We do estimate that the distance from the power plants to the epicenter is 20 milja.

North Haven, CT – MMI 5 checked – The floor underneath me at work shook NOTICEABLY (large plant/tree in front of my desk was SWAYING!) for about 15 – 20 sekundi. I looked outside to see if there was a huge 18-wheeler outside (and there was not). I’ve never felt an earthquake but I instinctively knew that this was something which could potentially be dangerous and I started to leave the building (1 story)but by the time I got up it had stopped.

New Jersey - MMI V – I was sitting at my desk at home and the entire desk was shaking and also my kitchen table. The dogs got up and was looking around to see what was up! I didn’t know what the heck was going on! I live in Northern New Jersey and my neighbor told me there was an earthquake! Crazy!

Oxford, Md. – MMI IV – Working in my office, seemed like floor became somewhat liquid, building movement less than 10 sekundi, but felt like I was on a boat in the water. Furniture swayed, pictures on wall moved, actually kind of exciting. No damage just the thrill.  Wow, an earthquake in Maryland. Go figure!

5.8 magnitude Virginia earthquake stuns Northeast U.S. – strongest quake in 114 years

August 23, 2011 – MINERAL, Va. (AP) — One of the strongest earthquakes ever recorded on the East Coast shook buildings and rattled nerves from South Carolina to New England on Tuesday and forced the evacuations of parts of the Capitol, White House and Pentagon. Skyscrapers swayed in New York, and frightened workers spilled into the streets. The National Cathedral in Washington said its central tower and three of its four corner spires were damaged. There were no immediate reports of deaths, but fire officials in Washington said there were at least some injuries. The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake registered magnitude 5.8 and was centered 40 miles northwest of Richmond, Va. The White House said advisers told President Barack Obama there have been no reports of major damage to the nation’s infrastructure, including airports and nuclear facilities. Two nuclear reactors at the North Anna Power Station, in the same county as the epicenter, were automatically taken off line by safety systems, said Roger Hannah, a spokesman for the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The earthquake came less than three weeks before the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks, and in both Washington and New York it immediately triggered fears of something more sinister than a natural disaster. At the Pentagon, a low rumbling built until the building itself was shaking, and people ran into the corridors of the complex. The shaking continued there, to shouts of “Evacuate! Evacuate!” The Park Service closed all monuments and memorials on the National Mall, and ceiling tiles fell at Reagan National Airport outside Washington. All flights there were put on hold. In lower Manhattan, the 26-story federal courthouse in lower Manhattan, blocks from ground zero of the Sept. 11 attacks, began swaying, and hundreds of people streamed out of the building. The New York police commissioner, Raymond Kelly, was in a meeting with top deputies planning security for the upcoming anniversary when the shaking started. Workers in the Empire State Building spilled into the streets, some having descended dozens of flights of stairs. –Yahoo News

No to both. I think everything was shaken in the tulmult, including building and cell phone towers. Mobile Cell service is unsually the first thing to go in an major earthquake. Faults in the U.S. are waking up.

It’s my understanding that cell service was interrupted due to EXTREMELY heavy call volume following the quake.  not from any damage to cell towers.  Gosh, we have that happen here in Norman, OK on football game days…  can’t get cell service cuz our town grows twice it’s size.  at kickoff, everyone seems to want to be on the phone with someone.  oh, and tornado threats, ya can’t get reliable cell service if a tornado warning goes out.  and i don’t think it’s the storm, it’s people calling other people!!

According to some news I saw, the quake was only 1 KM deep.  I believe this is a “shallow” quake, and shallow quakes are often felt more strongly.

It’s registering at 6 km, but they could always change and sometimes the first estimates are always wrong. An aftershock occurred that was less than 1 km….but you right, the shallower the quake, the most damage it can cause.

Well remember when I said I would start to worry when the USA starts getting earthquakes 5.0 or higher that time has arrived,just think if this would have happened along the new madrid all sand,the ground would have liquified and would have been very serious. The next one or more will be much more serious.Alvin what are youre thoughts on this and Colarado are they conected?

Many mothers were alarmed, children were all over the beach and in the water, and nobody knew where the quake was centered. Cell phones were not working and it was about 15 minutes until people started to report that it was on land in Va.  Meanwhile the lifeguards reassured the people that NJ has a seismic warning system out in the ocean and if there was a tsunami  there would be warnings. ( there are no sirens, but perhaps it would go to the firehouse and police?). I was a bit nervous and waiting to see if the water receeded at all, before we found out the EQ location, and wondering if I was an idiot to not run to my car immediately.   

My guess is the Virginia quake has torn a new gash along that fault – this may not be the last time she makes news. Thanks for the list,

I`M pretty sure you are going to be correct, hope this woke some people up to start to prepare, this was quite exciting for my family and myself to feel what an earthquake feels like, by the way I have been prepared for a few years now,  it`s going to get real interesting real soon, take care and get ready.

Finally, as exciting or frightening (depending on one’s point of view) the earthquake was, I am praying it is not taking people’s attention away from a very dangerous hurricane heading for the mid to upper East Coast. Now, more than ever, these people need to know what to do. 

Coming from southern CA, we’re pretty apathetic about earthquakes for the most part (last large one, they paused the ball game to the cheer of the crowd) – but, I do understand it was probably a bit of a shock for that region – can be pretty frightful for someone who has never felt one before (my boyfriend grew up in germany, and is pretty unnerved by the idea of the ground moving lol). And, judging by all the masonry in the street, buildings there clearly aren’t reinforced for seismic activity. Me, I’m much more intimidated by the idea of a hurricanes and tornadoes.

Scary experience. Wonder if any more big ones will hit here in Virginia. The only other earthquake I’ve experienced was a 4.8 or so in 2003, that was centered in Columbia, VA, just 40-50 miles west of where I lived at the time. This one in Mineral was approximately the same distance from where I live now. But it didn’t feel any stronger to me, for some reason. I was shocked when checking the news to find out it was a 5.9 and had been felt up and down the East Coast.

I just want to say thank you so much for your posts and to everyone for their comments. I learn so much from this blog, and have learned so much from your book as well.  I live close to the epicenter, and I thought my house was falling apart today because I was home alone and didn’t automatically think “earthquake” when I heard the loud noise and felt the walls shaking.  I was SO THANKFUL for the internet though because I got all the info quickly and I knew that you would post even more information here.   I am not looking forward to the day when we can no longer rely on electronic forms of communication. I think these recent earthquakes may be related to the heightened solar activity.

Last night my little grandson kept running in circles over and over.  His behavior reminded me of how animals act before earthquakes and other natural phenomena, so I laughed and asked him if an earthquake was coming because he couldn’t seem to stop himself from running around and around.  He looked me in the eye and told me “yes, Grandma”.  Then today the quake was felt all around our area and friends were calling to tell about what they experienced.  I was very interested to hear

this because we have had many “earthquakes” where I live due to the collapse of the AKZO-Nobel Retsof mine, and my daughter and I would always know a day before that one would occur.

I was in a building about 80 years old near Philadelphia.  Victorian type of house and on the second floor.  I felt the floor shaking under my feet and in the kitchen adjacent, i heard the ceiling fan rattling and appliances moving around.  It was about 20 seconds.  I realized it was an earthquake – not sure why.  But didn’t know its origins.  Never felt fear.  Actually, i was quite pleased to finally experience one.  And i could feel the general energy around me as feeling ‘charged’.

East vs. West quakes: Way different creatures

WASHINGTON (AP) — The East Coast doesn’t get earthquakes often but when they do strike, there’s a whole lot more shaking going on. The ground in the East is older, colder and more intact than the West Coast or the famous Pacific Ring of Fire. So East Coast quakes rattle an area up to 10 times larger than a similar-sized West Coast temblor.

Tuesday’s 5.8-magnitude quake was centered in Virginia and was felt up and down the Eastern seaboard for more than 1,000 miles. There hasn’t been a quake that large on the East Coast since 1944 in New York.

While this was a rarity for the East, a 5.8 quake isn’t unusual for California, Oregon, Washington and Alaska, where one occurs about once a year. Those states have had 103 quakes 5.8 or bigger since 1900, compared to now two in the East.

I felt the NSW aussie Newcastle and Cessnock quakes back in 1989 and 1994. Also one in Picton about 30-40 years ago.   Really disorients one, especially if it wakes you up.

One day in the very near future we are going to wake up to the news & be witness to a million or more souls killed in a single massive event. This event will be so horrific, so life changing for Mankind that it will be utterly incomprehensible to those that are unaware of the changes that are upon us. In no way am I being flippant about Japan or this latest quake in the US or floods & storms anywhere else but these events will be mere childs play compared to what is on the horizon, headed straight at us.

I have to wonder whether the corner Libya has now turned and these two unexpected quakes in the US are but a sign of the next path we are about to go down.

Dominion Virginia Power said both reactors at its North Anna plant, less than 20 miles from the epicenter of the magnitude-5.8 quake, shut down automatically after the first tremors. Amanda Reidelbach, an emergency management spokeswoman for Louisa County, said the plant vented steam, but there was no release of radioactive material. David Heacock, the utility’s chief nuclear officer, said the 1,800-megawatt plant was operating on emergency power and the two pressurized-water reactors were safely deactivated. “The plants are designed for this kind of a seismic event,” Heacock said. “There is no apparent damage to anything at the plant right now.” Crews were working to restore off-site power to the plant Tuesday evening, the utility said. Dan Stoddard, senior vice president of nuclear operations for Dominion, said some power from the grid had been restored to the reactors and it was possible full power could be achieved late Tuesday. It was not clear if a 4.2-magnitude aftershock Tuesday evening would affect the operation. Stoddard said there was no damage to the spent fuel pool. The diesel generators supplying backup power have enough fuel to operate 30 days and more can be brought in, if needed, Stoddard said. “The power plant is safe,” Stoddard said. One of those generators failed a few minutes after it kicked in, said Joey Ledford, a spokesman for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s regional office in Atlanta. But only one generator is required to supply power to each reactor unit, leaving another unit in reserve, Ledford said.

this is crazy sh*$, I fear that a bigger one will occur. this can maybe be a foreshock, a foreshock is an earthquake who is slightly smaller than the main quake who happens after the foreshock, but this is very unusual for the east coast, and it is very far away from the tectonic plate boundary who goes out in the atlantic ocean, right in the middle of atlantic ocean. I think the west coast of u.s is prepared for earthquakes, because it is usual that it happens there, since the TPB(tectonic plate boundary) goes right outside the coast there. I hope this don’t happen on the other side of the other side of the TPB. I live right over the other side, I live in Nortwest-Europe(Norway)

Our channel 7 6pm news did not even mention the Virginia quake.  A 5.8 quake felt by that many people!    Channel 10 11pm news did.  “US had two earthquakes today, one in New York and one in Washington DC”!!!!!!!!!!  (so they didn’t have one in Colorado).  Unbelievable.  

“Our channel 7 6pm news did not even mention the Virginia quake.”

1619/786  It is all about 114. A message was decoded in the United States on January 5, 1974. The message is mathematically coded with 19 as its common denominator. The number of chapters in this message is 114, 19 x 6. The 5.8 magnitude that happened in Virginia was the strongest earthquake in 114 years! Nobody talks about the 5.3 magnitude that happened on August 22nd. That was the strongest earthquake since the 5.7 magnitude in 1973. 2011 – 1973 is 38 and 38 is 19 x 2. The local time of the 5.3 in Colorado was 11:46:19. The Book has 114 chapters, the last chapter has 6 verses, and 19 is its mathematical code. The Book is, without a doubt, a revelation from the Lord of the universe! It contains all the information, it is the sealed book prophesized in Isiah 29:11. Who but GOD can give such an accurate specification such as 114,6,19? Praise be to GOD, Lord of the universe!

Inspectors check Virginia nuclear plant for earthquake damage The inspection is unusual, said Scott Burnell, a spokesman for NRC.  Such “augmented inspection teams” are dispatched to nuclear plants  “infrequently. If I had to put a number on it I’d say once every couple  of years.” 

During the quake, 36 “scratch plates” at the facility  recorded ground motion in three dimensions, said Richard Zuercher, a  Dominion spokesman. Preliminary analysis of the plates performed by a  seismologist contracted by Dominion showed “the plant may have exceeded  design basis for ground-force acceleration,” Zuercher said. 

The  plant’s reactor containment buildings were built to withstand shaking  equal to 12 percent of the force of gravity. Dominion said on the day of  the quake that the plant would be safe up to a magnitude 6.2   earthquake. But the amount of shaking such a quake produces varies with  distance to the epicenter, depth, and the type of rock the quake occurs  in.

 Virginia quake shakes up the PGA Tour     People gather on the streets for safety in lower Manhattan after the earthquake hit. STORY HIGHLIGHTSGolfers at The Barclays in Virginia reacted to Tuesday's earthquake on TwitterPGA Tour players were in New Jersey preparing for the FedEx Cup playoff eventNo serious injuries were reported in the wake of the 5.8 magnitude quake  (CNN) -- Golfers preparing for The Barclays FedEx Cup playoff event at Plainfield Country Club in New Jersey found themselves not only battling the course, but also the effects of a 5.8 magnitude earthquake which struck Virginia on Tuesday. The quake forced the closure of a nuclear power plant and was felt from as far afield as Georgia and New England, while also causing many PGA Tour players to post their reactions on the social-networking site Twitter. American world number 15 Bubba Watson used his @bubbawatson account to tweet: "This house we rented just shook!" Watson's compatriot Jason Dufner, who finished tied for 5th at the recent PGA Championship, also tweeted his shock after feeling the tremors: "Earthquake in Jersey? Or someone trying to give me a shake down??" Virginia earthquake rattles the East Coast 

The 2007 Masters champion Zach Johnson was clearly concerned by the quake, in which no major injuries were reported, and tweeted: "Well. Just went through my first earthquake. Gotta believe it wasn't a big one here in NJ. But, it freaked me out. #kneesbuckled." Briton Justin Rose has been on the PGA Tour since 2003 and was on the driving range when he felt the quake. "Was that an earthquake I just felt on the range in New Jersey!!" read his tweet. "Either that or Gary Woodland is thumping out 2 irons on range!!" Woodland, a 27-year-old one-time winner on the Tour, posted: "Earthquake in jersey. Thought a kid was shaking my chair. Crazy." The FedEx Cup playoffs are now in their fifth year and serve as a season-ending championship for the Tour, with The Barclays set to get under way on Thursday. A field of 125 players have qualified for The Barclays based on points accumulated over the course of the year. Out of those 125, the top 75 will advance to the Deutsche Bank tournament in Boston, before the field is cut to 70 for the BMW Championship in Illinois -- which will begin on September 15. Finally, 30 players will head to Atlanta for the final tournament, due to start on September 22, where the FedEx Cup champion will be crowned.

Yesterday afternoon’s unusual earthquake had stations near its epicenter mobilizing all their resources to tell viewers in Richmond, Lynchburg and Charlottesville what was happening through cut-ins and wall-to-wall coverage.

Within minutes of Tuesday’s Virginia earthquake, TV stations near the temblor’s epicenter went live with coverage letting viewers know what had rocked their world.

Rattled a bit themselves, news crews in markets like Richmond (DMA 57), Lynchburg (DMA 66) and Charlottesville (DMA 183) broke away from network programming with either wall-to-wall or live cut-in quake coverage.

Although damage from the 5.8 magnitude earthquake — which hit near Mineral at 1:51 p.m. and was felt along the East Coast — was minimal, the unexpected seismic event sent shock waves through the area.

WVIR’s team was in good company as the earthquake — which evacuated some newsrooms – sent crews scrambling to get information to viewers who wanted it fast and furiously.

At WTVR, Local TV’s CBS affiliate in Richmond, station employees from sales reps to support staff pitched in, while the station went wall-to-wall with earthquake coverage from about 2:30 to 6:30 p.m., according to Travis Ponton, a photojournalist and assignment desk editor.

WTVR, like other stations in the area, relied heavily on viewers’ Facebook and Twitter posts to learn how neighborhoods and residents were affected by the quake. The station aired video from its newsroom security camera to show the temblor in action.

From a newsperson’s perspective, the quake happened at a particularly opportune time, as its mid-afternoon strike meant there were plenty of people out and about to share their stories, said Jim Hanchett, news director of WCAV, Gray’s CBS affiliate in Charlottesville.

A reporter out for lunch at the time was able to get the security tape from a nearby supermarket. Another covered the quake from a local elementary school, where the reporter was supposed to be doing a story on today’s start of the school year.

Randy Smith, president of WSET, the Allbritton ABC affiliate in Lynchburg, said the station’s chief meteorologist (who apparently didn’t expect to use his Earth science education as a weathercaster in Virginia) sent out a Tweet confirming the quake just two minutes after it hit.

The stations' phone lines went wild as well. “Our switchboard was absolutely jammed for perhaps the first 40 minutes after the earthquake,” Smith said.

                                    In a 'never let a disaster go to waste' moment, Jay Rockefeller is using the VA quake to push his spectrum auction bill with the CTIA claiming that there was cellphone congestion.  But as this article shows, broadcast TV was right there providing emergency information in a way that no cellphone alert system could.  Of course, we out in California are asking, "5.8?  What's the big deal?"

6.5 magnitude earthquake jolts Japan

6.1 quake shakes Aleutian Islands

RICHMOND, Va., Aug. 23 (UPI) -- An earthquake rattled Northern Virginia Tuesday, briefly causing a power shutdown at a nuclear plant and emptying the White House in nearby Washington.

The 5.8-magnitude quake was the strongest in Virginia in more than a century, and shook cities all along the Eastern Seaboard of the United States. U.S. emergency officials said there were no reports of major damage, but cellphone usage was congested and the public was asked to use e-mail instead.

The White House said President Barack Obama, on vacation in Martha's Vineyard off Massachusetts, held a conference call with Cabinet secretaries and advisers "to discuss the earthquake and the status of critical infrastructure."

The central tower of the National Cathedral, the highest elevation in Washington, sustained damage to three of its four spires, The Washington Post reported. Some animals at the National Zoo, evidently sensing the quake before it hit, seemed to call out warnings, the newspaper said.

The Pentagon, the world's largest office building, was partially evacuated after its foundation was shaken by the earthquake. Employees were permitted to return to work shortly after 2 p.m., the Post reported.

The U.S. Geological Survey, headquartered for the East in nearby Reston, Va., said the epicenter of the quake was 34 miles northwest of Richmond, Va., and 87 miles southwest of Washington.

The quake struck at 1:51 p.m. at a depth of 3.7 miles.

The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported the quake was felt in Washington, New York and North Carolina. The newspaper said buildings swayed, and damage reports had begun to trickle in.

The Times-Dispatch said the epicenter was not far from Dominion Virginia Power's North Anna nuclear plant in Louisa County. The quake knocked out power, but the utility said it had manually shut down both nuclear units without incident.

"We did lose on-site power, but all the diesel generators are up and running," Dominion spokesman Richard Zuercher told the newspaper 30 minutes after the quake. "Everything appears to be operating just fine."

Four miles from the quake's epicenter, residents of Mineral, Va., reported extensive damage to items inside homes, the Times said. Mineral has about 500 people.

In Rockville, Md., 10 miles north of Washington, the quake was felt for 20-30 seconds. It started slowly but built into an event that shook houses. One man said he could see the windows shake on neighbors' houses.

The quake stopped a tennis event in New Haven, Conn., and shook the field during an afternoon baseball game between the Mariners and Indians in Cleveland.

Play at the New Haven Open on the campus of Yale University was stopped after the shock of the earthquake shook the stadium. The building was also evacuated and matches resumed after a about three hours

The Virginia quake followed an 5.2-magnitude quake in Colorado Monday night. The quake struck at 2.5 miles depth, about 180 miles south of Denver and was the strongest in the area in more than 40 years. 

			Safety netting is seen installed over the nave of the National Cathedral as a safety precaution following the 5.8-magnitude earthquake that struck the east coast last week, in Washington on September 1, 2011. The nets will remain in place until repairs are completed to the Cathedral. The Cathedral will open to the public in time for the September 11th memorial service.  UPI/Kevin Dietsch
