BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- A total of 1,097 aftershocks have been monitored in the strong quake-hit Lushan County as of 6 a.m. Beijing Time Sunday, authorities said.
Three of the aftershocks were measured within a range of 5.0 to 5.9 magnitude, according to the China Earthquake Administration (CEA).
A 7-magnitude earthquake hit Lushan county, Ya'an city of southwest China's Sichuan Province, at 8:02 a.m. Saturday Beijing Time, leaving 160 people dead and 6,700 injured as of 0:40 a.m. Sunday.
A national earthquake emergency rescue team has arrived Sunday morning at Lushan for disaster relief, the CEA said.
The team is made up of 200 rescue staff including 21 seismologists and 39 medical staff, according to the CEA. They have brought to the quake area more than 30 tonnes of supplies.
Meanwhile, more than 800 police and rescue staff have entered the badly-hit Baoxing County, where communication and transportation were seriously affected.
Lushan is about 200 kilometers from the epicenter of the massive Wenchuan earthquake 5 years ago that left 87,000 dead or missing.
