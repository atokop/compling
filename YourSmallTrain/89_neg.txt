                Over 10 years ago a 
                browser was born.
                Its name was Internet Explorer 6. Now that we're in 2013, in an era of modern web standards, it’s time to say goodbye.
                This website is dedicated to watching Internet Explorer 6 usage drop to less
                    than 1% worldwide, so more websites can choose to drop support for
                Internet Explorer 6, saving hours of work for web developers.
            
                Here's what you can do.
