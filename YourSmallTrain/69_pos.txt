Graphics: Sitting on the Same Faultline
In facing the unexpected, a look at the Ya'an and Wenchuan disaster responses to earthquake-hit areas in Sichuan Province
By staff reporter Zhao Bingyang
(Beijing) – The Ya'an quake that jolted China's southwestern Sichuan province on the morning of April 20 has brought back echoes of a massive earthquake which occurred in the same area just five years ago. Rescue work is still underway in quake-battered areas of Sichuan Province and by the morning of April 23, the death toll climbed to 193 people, while 25 are missing. Several hundred were severely injured, with the quake affecting an estimated 1.5 million in the area.
Some experts said the latest quake was another aftershock of the 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake which killed 69,000 people. Both the Ya'an and Wenchuan quakes occurred on the Longmenshan Fault, which runs along the boundary of the Sichuan Basin. 
But Jiang Haikun, an official at the China Earthquake Networks Center, said despite the fact that both earthquakes formed in a similar way, the Ya'an quake was not an aftershock of the Wenchuan Earthquake. Jiang said earthquakes on the 500 kilometer Longmenshan Fault are not frequent but very powerful. Twelve quakes above 5.0 magnitude have occurred since 1900, including Wenchuan in 2008 at 8.0, the most powerful quake to date. The Ya'an Earthquake was 7.0 on the Richter scale, according to China's seismological bureau. 
The latest quake in Ya'an caused fewer damage to buildings compared to 2008, which led to massive landslides and building collapses. 
Caixin reporters found that land preservation projects and strong geological structures in Ya'an led to fewer landslides and aftershocks. In addition, building materials used in the area were much stronger than those used in Wenchuan. Catastrophic human and economic losses during 2008 offered several lessons on earthquake preparedness and disaster relief plans.
