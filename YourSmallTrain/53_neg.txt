"We know al Qaeda [leader Ayman al-] Zawahiri is supporting the opposition in Syria.” ~ Hillary Clinton (to CBS News February 27, 2012)
NJ.com - The Star Ledger -﻿ March 22, 2013 - "Aiding Al Qaida as part of the War on Terror?"
That's what McCain and Graham are doing. “Do you support the call by John McCain and Lindsey Graham for the U.S. to intervene on the side of the rebels in Syria? Congratulations! You're on the same side as the Muslim Brotherhood and Al Qaeda. ~ Paul Mulshine
