Charlottesville, VA --
Updated Thursday, August 25, 6:00 a.m.
There have been at least five aftershocks following Tuesday's east coast earthquake,  including one big one overnight.
The magnitude 4.5 earthquake was centered about 31 miles east of Charlottesville, Virginia. at 1:07 a.m. EST Thursday.
Experts say aftershocks will continue for some time.
UPDATED ON WEDNESDAY AUGUST 24:  The 5.8-magnitude earthquake Tuesday that shook people from Georgia to Canada has produced at least four aftershocks. The U.S. Geological Survey says the aftershocks around the central Virginia epicenter ranged in magnitude from 4.2 to as little as 2.2 since the strongest earthquake to strike the East Coast since World War II.
Amy Vaughan, a geophysicist with the National Earthquake Information Center in Colorado, says the number of aftershocks so far has been remarkably low. Vaughan says the agency isn't sure what to expect, but it's likely there will be some more for days, if not weeks. Typically, the larger the quake, the longer and the greater extent of aftershocks.
POSTED ON TUESDAY AUGUST 23: A 5.8 magnitude earthquake centered northwest of Richmond, Va., shook much of Washington, D.C., and was felt as far north as Rhode Island and New York City.
The U.S. Geological Survey said the earthquake happened around 1:51 PM. They say it was was 3.7 miles deep.
370 miles from Spartanburg, SC4 miles SSE (152°) from Louisa, VA 4 miles SW (236°) from Mineral, VA 16 miles SE (133°) from Gordonsville, VA 20 miles E (79°) from Lake Monticello, VA 41 miles NW (318°) from Richmond, VA 83 miles SW (219°) from Washington, DC
Shaking was felt at the White House and all over the East Coast, as far south as Chapel Hill, N.C. Parts of the Pentagon, White House and Capitol were evacuated. The quake was in Mineral, Va., in Louisa County.
Several buildings were evacuated in the Upstate but no one has reported any damage to the 911.
The Spartanburg County library was evacuated for about 15 minutes after the tremor. Todd Stephens, County Librarian, says they got everybody out of the building as a precaution.
"The idea was just to get everybody out," Stephens said. "You have all these shelves, the last thing you want to do is get caught in a situation where things are bad, so the safest place for us was to get everybody into the parking lot.
In the Greenville County School District, a spokesperson says they did feel some minor tremors and schools were evacuated, but so far there are no reports of damage.
Tom Gold heard and felt his house shake in Cowpens.
"It was like something had come into the house, be it people, car, or whatever," said Gold. "It wasn't a crashing sound, it was more of a rumble."
You can help the US Geological Survey better understand earthquakes. Let them know if you felt ut by going to their website http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/dyfi/
Federal officials say nuclear plants from North Carolina to Michigan are under increased scrutiny after the quake.    
Twelve nuclear plants declared what regulators call "unusua levents."      
Two nuclear reactors at Virginia's North Anna Power Station, in the same county as the epicenter, were automatically taken off line by safety systems. No damage was reported at the plant, which isbeing powered by emergency diesel generators.     
The quake was also felt at the Surry nuclear plant near Newport News, but a spokesman said both reactors there continued to operate safely.    
Besides Surry, nuclear plants in Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey ,North Carolina and Pennsylvania were placed under increased scrutiny, but continued to operate.
