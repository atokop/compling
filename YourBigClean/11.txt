Was the Virginia Earthquake Induced by HAARP; Attempt to Steer Hurricane Irene?

Activist Post

The High Frequency Active Auroral Research Project (HAARP) might be the most important thing on Earth to not only barely penetrate the fringes of public understanding, but of public concern.

Please, in no way feel remiss or alone if you have never even heard of HAARP. When the military industrial complex spends this much of your money to menace you and everybody else—even all life on Earth, they tend to hide it. Black-budgets, DARPA and all that stuff. And they spare little expense (your money, again, of course) trying to keep you from having a clue.

Perhaps the most important aspect of HAARP is not whether it is already being used as a sinister weapon, but, rather, at the new astronomical power levels in the gigawatts exactly what is HAARP capable of? What can HAARP really do?

Is it possible that in using HAARP to try to steer hurricane Irene away from the eastern seaboard and minimize the potential for widespread catastrophic damage from what meteorologists say could come ashore as a monster category 4 hurricane—is it possible that the Virginia earthquake was accidentally induced? Extensive information available to the public implies the answer is yes.

Don’t look for any accurate information about HAARP to come from corporate media. If there is even a peep in CorpoMedia about HAARP it will surely focus on it being a benign research project. 

At least currently, the Internet offers substantial truth regarding HAARP technologies and applications—but as awareness spreads, censorship, and pollution with bizarre red herrings will prevail, as usual.

Please consider visiting some of the tiny sample of websites listed below as an introduction to HAARP. And for an excellent presentation of the evolution of hurricane Irene, including whether or not it seems to be having its trajectory influenced artificially, you might want to visit Weather Underground. 

As far as the Virginia earthquake being a product of HAARP, please learn more about this technology, and decide for yourself. There is great possibility that HAARP has already affected all of our lives in ways that seem incredible.

Why would the cabal target their own HQ? This was much more likely a scalar weapon warning from China to the cabal to stop devaluing the US$ with their money printing.

They are steering the hurricane. However, it's not like steering a 300ZX and the storm can't be turned with pin point accuracy. If you look at a line from Alaska to where the hurricane was beginning to turn sharply, VA is right in the path.One huge point everyone is missing is that most cell service went out 6 hours prior to the earthquake within 250 miles of epicenter

Anonymous #2: You are right on. Haarp is already getting scrubbed as a serious, "don't talk about it." We should applaud and support Activist Post for their independence and intelligence---shown repeatedly in their great articles.

What is the technology behind  global environmental warfare? Strictly speaking, it is a 'resonant frequency weapon', because it generates and directs a very powerful radio beam at the target's resonant frequency. This results in the release of an exponentially greater quantity of potential energy. The beam can be transmitted long distances by being reflected between the ionosphere and lower, artificially ionized atmospheric layers created by chemtrails. Traditional weapons merely deliver energy. HAARP delivers a large amount of radio energy in order to release a huge amount of kinetic and heat energy depending on the target. This is described in one of the HAARP patents. The technology was described by National Security Adviser Brzezinski in 1971 and Secretary of Defense Cohen in 1997. The Pentagon has several dozen HAARP facilities around the world, but this is a World Government weapon, since the US military is under virtually complete World Government control. Although the Russians and the Chinese have the resonant frequency weapon they are not so stupid as to get into a tit for tat war with the United States. Why do they not need to attack America? Because the World Government is doing that for them by destroying America from inside, using economic, environmental and cultural warfare. Unlike Russia and China, the United States has long ceased to be sovereign nation state. The many anomalies of modern American politics testify to that.

Superb comment, Gordon. Your level of not only understanding modern dynamics, but so expertly expressing your awareness is very impressive. If only it wasn't so rare...but rarity enhances value, and we are desperately in need of your kind of value. Few of the most critical problems in humanity's face seem any less than a function of overwhelming, cultivated and nurtured death of public awareness.More power to you.

My first though was that the unusual quake along our East Coast was somehow related to Japan's 9.0 earthquake. That quake shifted the position of Earth's axis by 6.5 inches. It had been 1200 years since a quake of this magnitude hit Japan's plate boundary.

It's not about weather warfare. They're trying to move us ahead in the ranking system to a higher class of civilization while maintaining the idea that the gerneral public is to young and stupid to handle what's going on. The only reason people are so stupid is because they're not informed of what's going on. Really though it won't work. They will see threw your plotting.
