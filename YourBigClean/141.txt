Published: Wednesday, Aug. 24, 2011 -  8:09 am

SANTA BARBARA, Calif., Aug. 24, 2011 --     /PRNewswire/ -- The largest earthquake to hit Virginia in more than a century struck Louisa County yesterday.The 5.9 earthquake hit Virginia at 1:51 p.m. on August 23, but the effects were felt in several states including Washington, New York City and North Carolina.No injuries or major damage were reported but many buildings were evacuated and masses of people flooded the streets.  Some buildings also experienced electrical loss.    

    The quake comes one day after a 5.3 magnitude earthquake struck Colorado.  That quake reportedly caused only minor damage and no injuries.According to the US Geological Survey (GUSG), several million earthquakes occur annually but most are not realized because the majority of quakes are too small to be felt. Other significant earthquakes that struck the US this year include the 4.1 magnitude quakes that hit Northern California and Arkansas on January 8 and February 18 respectively.The largest recorded earthquake to hit the US was a magnitude 9.2 that stuck Prince William Sound, Alaska on March 28, 1964.  The largest recorded quake in the world was a magnitude 9.5 quake that occurred in Chile on May 22, 1960.On this day in 1985, a magnitude 7.5 quake hit China and resulted in at least 71 deaths and 162 injuries.  On this day in 1980, a magnitude quake in India took the lives of 15 and left 40 injured.Find and compare historic earthquakes on FindTheBest's Earthquakes Comparison and learn about the top 5 earthquakes with magnitudes of 9 and above, the top 5 earthquakes in terms of injuries and death counts, and the top 5 earthquakes in terms of damage done.SOURCE  FindTheBest.com

About Comments

Reader comments on Sacbee.com are the opinions of the writer, not The Sacramento Bee. If you see an objectionable comment, click the flag icon below it. We will delete comments containing inappropriate links, obscenities, hate speech, and personal attacks. Flagrant or repeat violators will be banned. See more about comments here.

What You Should Know About Comments on Sacbee.com
Sacbee.com is happy to provide a forum for reader interaction, discussion, feedback and reaction to our stories.  However, we reserve the right to delete inappropriate comments or ban users who can't play nice. (See our full terms of service here.)
Here are some rules of the road:
 Keep your comments civil. Don't insult one another or the subjects of our articles.  If you think a comment violates our guidelines click the flag icon to notify the moderators. Responding to the comment will only encourage bad behavior. 
 Don't use profanities, vulgarities or hate speech.  This is a general interest news site.  Sometimes, there are children present. Don't say anything in a way you wouldn't want your own child to hear. 
 Do not  attack other users; focus your comments on issues, not individuals. 
 Stay on topic.  Only post comments relevant to the article at hand.  If you want to discuss an issue with a specific user, click on his profile name and send him a direct message. 
 Do not copy and paste outside material into the comment box. 
 Don't repeat the same comment over and over.  We heard you the first time. 
 Do not use the commenting system for advertising. That's spam and it isn't allowed. 
 Don't use all capital letters.  That's akin to yelling and not appreciated by the audience. 
 Don't flag other users' comments just because you don't agree with their point of view.  Please only flag comments that violate these guidelines. 
You should also know that The Sacramento Bee does not screen comments before they are posted.  You are more likely to see inappropriate comments before our staff does, so we ask that you click the flag icon to submit those comments for moderator review.  You also may notify us via email at feedback@sacbee.com.  Note the headline on which the comment is made and tell us the profile name of the user who made the comment. Remember, comment moderation is subjective.  You may find some material objectionable that we won't and vice versa.
If you submit a comment, the user name of your account will appear along with it.  Users cannot remove their own comments once they have submitted them.
