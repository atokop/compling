@bulerias81 Guess you didn't know that the USA has been getting threats about the ten year 9/11 anniversary. Last time we didn't take the threats seriously, 9/11 happened. How about you go look up everything before saying something? People have a right to be scared that they are being attacked when threats from the same group and﻿ multiple others have been made.

@bulerias81 AND at the capital of the country? A terrorist attack is feared there,﻿ and 9/11 shows it can happen anytime.

This is the same day that Prophet Owuor predicted an earthquake will hit the western world in the near future. The city will have tall skycraper buildings, it will be at night, The﻿ quake will last 42 secs and will break land so badly it will turn it in an anit clock wise position. This will be a sign from God. Repent! Jesus is coming.

@bulerias81 Sure we might get screwed a little here, but it isnt fatal. Its not like we're getting mustard gased, have scud missiles dropped into our middle class suburban neighborhoods, or are getting executed in our soccer fields, but God forbid if we have a﻿ tax hike or get pulled aside by TSA for a random screening at the airport.

@kjburger12 your thinking of the New Madrid fault near the Mississipi r. in1811 and 1812 there were 3 quakes﻿ in the 7.8 to8.2 magnitude. on the modified mercalli scale a measure of shaking intensity 1-12 it est they were @9-11 by comparison the 5.9 quake you felt was a 7. this quake might be a sign of more seismic on its way or could be a foreshck of a quake that that wont happen for 50-100 yrs. if the New Madrid goes off it wont be pretty.
