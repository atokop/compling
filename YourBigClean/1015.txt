#Radiation in Food: Radish Boya to Set Its Own Cesium Standard

Radish Boya, an online grocer who first alerted Shizuoka Prefecture that one of the Shizuoka contained radioactive cesium exceeded the provisional limit by its own testing, is going to set its own standard for cesium in food and drinks that it sells, which is one-tenths of the national provisional standards.From Yomiuri Shinbun (9/5/2011):食品宅配サービスの「らでぃっしゅぼーや」（本社・東京）は５日、同社で販売する食品や飲料水などに対する放射性セシウムの自主規制値を設定したと発表した。Radish Boya, a home delivery service of foodstuff headquartered in Tokyo, announced on September 5 that the company had set its own safety limit for radioactive cesium in food and drinks that it sells.自主規制値は、コメや青果物、肉類が１キロ・グラムあたり５０ベクレル、牛乳や飲料水が同２０ベクレルで、いずれも国の暫定規制値の１０分の１となる。The company's safety limit for rice, vegetables and fruits, and meat is 50 becquerels/kilogram, and for milk and drinking water 20 becquerels[/liter]. They are both one-tenths of the national provisional safety limits.　東北・関東甲信越の１７都県を産地とする食品などは、入荷前に抜き取り検査を行い、自主規制値を超えるものは配達しない。同社は１０万５０００人が会員登録しているが、福島第一原子力発電所の事故以降、食品の放射能汚染に関する問い合わせが１万件以上あったという。The company will conduct sample testing before it purchases the food items from 17 prefectures in Tohoku and Kanto, and will not deliver the items whose cesium content exceeds the company's safety limit. The company has 105,000 registered customers, and there have been over 10,000 inquiries about radiation contamination of food after the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant accident.Things to keep in mind, before you rush to order:Radish Boya does source from Tohoku and northern Kanto, including Fukushima, Miyagi, and Tochigi, and radioactive cesium has been detected in their testing though not exceeding the provisional safety limit or the company's own limit;The testing is still a sample testing, though for now there's no practical way to test all;It does participate in the campaign by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, "Let's help the disaster-affected areas by eating their produce!"By the way, looking at the Ministry of Agriculture's site, they do seem to feed the government workers there with potentially contaminated vegetables and meat from the disaster-affected areas...

Kunihiko Takeda: "A Girl Doesn't Talk"

Professor Takeda of Chubu University has an unusual, short post on his blog for September 5. It's titled "A Girl Doesn't Talk..." and the following is my unauthorized, quick translation:
A girl doesn't talk...
 She doesn't talk. With her clear eyes she looks at everything her mother does. At her side, a boy with bright eyes is excited with the train just passing by.
 A middle-aged man shouts. Why can't I sell contaminated vegetables? I took great pains growing them. What about our livelihood?
 The girl doesn't talk. She quietly eats her school lunch as it is served. Even if the vegetables are contaminated, she takes in the radioactive materials because she trusts adults.
 The angry middle-aged man, with the help of the governor and the board of education, shipped the contaminated vegetables that were sold as foodstuff for the school lunches, and he made the living. The government and TEPCO pretended they didn't know, and the media was afraid to report.
 The girl who didn't talk is now sick in bed. Who could have saved this girl who didn't talk?
 少女は語らない・・・
 少女は語らない。その澄んだ目でお母さんの一挙手一投足を見つめている。からわらでつぶらな瞳の少年が通り過ぎる電車に夢中になる。
 おじさんは怒鳴る！　何で汚染された野菜を出していけないのか！　こんなに苦労して作ったんだ！　我々の生活はどうでもよいのか！
 少女は語らない。ただ黙々と出された給食を食べる。たとえ汚染された野菜でも、彼女は大人を信じて放射性物質を体の中に入れる。
 怒鳴ったおじさんは、知事と教育委員会に助けられ、汚染野菜を出荷し、給食の食材として販売し、生計を立てた。政府と東電は知らぬ顔をし、マスコミはびびった。
 語らなかった少女はやがて病の床につく。誰が語らなかった少女を助けることができたのだろうか？Professor Takeda has his share of detractors and critics, but ever since March 11 he has consistently spoke against radiation exposure for children and adults and denounced the government (particularly Ministry of Education, Board of Education, and teachers), TEPCO and experts (particularly medical experts) for making light of the danger of radiation exposure. (See my post from May for his strong words to teachers.)

#Radioactive Produce: National Government Told Fukushima Farmers to Farm as Usual

It is unconfirmed information, which may not be confirmed at all even if it is true as it may have been the "administrative guidance" from the government without a formal document. Plausible deniability has been one of Japan's forte over hundreds of years if not thousand.
 A resident of Fukushima City, responding to one of the tweets about why the farmers in Fukushima farmed at all this year and continue to sell produce even when they are aware that the land is heavily contaminated with radioactive fallout from Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant, says the following:
みんな「今年は無理だ。」って言ってたのに、国が「普通に作れ。」って言ったんです。
 Everyone was saying "We can't farm this year". Then the national government said to them, "Farm as usual".She also says in an earlier tweet:
福島市在住です。まわりの人はみんな食べません。だって農家が「今年は食えない」って言います。私は「今後は食えない」だと思っていますが
 I live in Fukushima City. None of the people around me eat [Fukushima produce]. Even the farmers say "We can't eat this year['s produce]". I personally believe it's "we can't eat from now on".Vegetables, meat, rice that even some people in Fukushima don't eat are being promoted and sold all over Japan.
 To the defense of Fukushima farmers, I am aware that there are many who stopped farming after the accident, and stopped selling their produce because they do not want to force potentially contaminated food on the consumers.
 Another "un-confirmable" evidence of the national government's culpability is one particular tweet from March which I cannot locate any more but I remember very vividly. It was from someone whose family was the rice farmer in Niigata Prefecture. The JA (agricultural producer co-op) in the area held a meeting and decided to increase the area for planting rice because they thought the rice production in Fukushima would be significantly reduced because of the nuclear accident. To that request, the national government (Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries) answered not to bother, and told them to reduce the area for planting rice as scheduled.
 Extend and pretend. The national government wanted to pretend to the farmers, to the citizens of Japan and to the outside world that everything was normal, and insisted the farmers in Fukushima till the land and plant just like last year, and the rice farmers in Niigata to reduce their crop as agreed last year. Many Fukushima farmers, even though their good senses told them that might be a bad idea, went along for whatever reason, tilled the land and planted.
 No doubt they were soothed by the comforting message from Dr. Shunichi Yamashita, who was all over Fukushima preaching it was safe and everything was OK.
 As the result, radioactive cesium, plutonium, cobalt, and whatever else fell on top of the soil were turned over with the soil and buried deeper and mixed with clean soil.
 And this national government under the new administration continues to say it will be responsible for decontamination. It is as if they wanted the soil contamination to go deeper so that the decontamination would be on a much, much bigger scale than otherwise, creating bigger and costlier projects for the well-connected companies and individuals.
 The minister who will be in charge of decontamination and other massive cleanup efforts says we have to share the pain of Fukushima, even as the pain was partly caused and made worse by his government to begin with.
 I suppose they could justify the astronomical scale of decontamination by saying "it will create jobs in the area", which is exactly what they said when they promoted nuclear power plants in rural areas of Japan in the 1960s.
 Dig the ditch, bury the ditch, as long as it create jobs. Japanese Keynesians still hard at work. It's just that "ditch" is radioactive.

Hosono: "We All Have to Share the Pain of Fukushima"

Goshi Hosono, former assistant to ex-prime minister Kan Naoto, current minister in charge of the Fukushima nuclear accident and the new Minister of the Environment whose Ministry will have the regulatory agency for the nuclear industry and will be in charge also of the government "decontamination" and cleanup effort in Tohoku, declared on September 4 that the entire Japan must share the pain of Fukushima.
 He might as well include the entire northern hemisphere, as this, as many in Japan outside Fukushima have taken to mean spreading the radioactive debris all over Japan to expedite the disposal so that "Fukushima can recover". Japan's favorite method of disposing the debris and garbage, as you now know, is to burn.
 From NHK News Japanese (4:42PM JST 9/4/2011):
原発事故で放射性物質に汚染されたがれきや土壌の最終処分場について細野環境大臣は４日の会見で「福島の痛みを日本全体で分かち合うことが国としての配慮だ」と述べ、福島県以外に設けたいという考えを示しました。
 Minister of the Environment Hosono said in the September 4 press conference that "it is the consideration of the national government [or as Japan as the nation] to share the pain of Fukushima by everyone [or everywhere] in Japan", reiterating his intention to create a final processing facility outside Fukushima Prefecture for debris and dirt contaminated with radioactive materials from the nuclear accident.
 これは４日行われた就任会見で、細野環境大臣が明らかにしました。原発事故で放射性物質に汚染されたがれきや放射性物質を取り除く除染作業で出た土壌などの処分をめぐっては、先月、菅前総理大臣が福島県の佐藤知事に対し、一時的に管理する中間貯蔵施設を県内に整備する方向で検討していることやその施設を最終処分場にすることは考えていないという意向を伝えています。
 The September 4 press conference was his first as the Minister of the Environment. Regarding the disposal of the contaminated debris and dirt removed by the decontamination work, ex-Prime Minister Kan told Governor of Fukushima Sato last month that the national government was proceeding with the plan to create a temporary storage facility in Fukushima but it had no intention of turning this facility into a final processing facility.
 ４日の会見で細野大臣は、中間貯蔵施設について「具体的な場所や保管しておく期間については地元の理解がなくては進めることができない」と述べ、施設を設ける場所などについては今後、地元と十分話し合ったうえで決めたいという考えを示しました。
 In the September 4 press conference, Hosono said of the temporary storage facility, "We won't proceed without consulting the local people in deciding the specific location and the duration of the storage", indicating the details will be worked out after consultation with the local people.
 また、最終処分場については中間貯蔵施設とは別だという認識を示した上で、「福島の痛みを日本全体で分かち合うことが国としての配慮ではないかと思っている。福島を最終処分場にはしないということは方針としてできる限り貫きたい」と述べ、福島県以外に設けたいという考えを示しました。
 As to the final processing facility, he said he considered it separate from the temporary storage facility, and said further, "I believe it should be the consideration of the national government [or Japan as the nation] to share the pain of Fukushima by everyone in Japan [or everywhere in Japan]. It is my intention to stick to the plan that the final processing facility will never be built in Fukushima", reiterating his idea of creating the final processing facility outside Fukushima Prefecture.
From the Japanese word 国 (nation) as used by politicians like him, it's hard to figure which he means: national government, or the nation as a whole. In their mind, clearly they're one and the same.
 How spreading the radioactive debris all over Japan to be processed and thus potentially contaminating all over Japan is supposed to ease the "pain" felt in Fukushima is simply beyond me. I would love to hear whether people in Fukushima feel their view is well represented by Minister Goshi. Maybe it is, though I hope it isn't. (Hope is not a good trading vehicle.)
 The newly installed prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, has already said, "Without the rebirth of Fukushima, there will be no rebirth of Japan".
 I guess there will be no rebirth of Japan.
 Those of you who are currently in Japan, you can share your views by leaving a message to Minister Hosono at the following numbers (from this tweet):
細野 豪志議員会館620号室電話03-3508-7116 FAX03-3508-3416 ■ 三島事務所 TEL055-991-1269 FAX055-991-1270 ■ 富士事務所 TEL0545-55-5411 FAX0545-55-5412
You can also send a message to him via his website: http://goshi.org/contact/ Mr. Hosono is the one who admitted on national TV that the Kan administration knew from the beginning that it was a core meltdown at Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant, but they (him included) "just did not feel like announcing it".

Future Challenge for Yokohama City Mayor: Bring Back Foreign Tourists

Mayor of Yokohama City Fumiko Hayashi has an illustrious career. Armed only with a high school diploma, she became the CEO of one of Japan's biggest supermarket chains (Daiei) after selling BMWs as the president of BMW Tokyo.
 Her motto as the mayor - "Sympathy and trust in government".
 She didn't count on having a major nuclear accident on her second year in office, but here it is, and what has her city administration done to deal with the crisis?
 Tokyo Shinbun conducted the exclusive interview with the mayor and reported on August 31 in its Kanagawa local version:
横浜市長に就任してから、２年を経過した林文子市長（６５）が本紙のインタビューに応じた。原発事故による市の放射線をめぐる対応について「横浜は安全だと発信してきた。最善でやっていると思う」と指摘。市庁舎の建設問題には「区役所の整備が優先」との考えを示した。　（聞き手・荒井六貴）
 Mayor Fumiko Hayashi (age 65) has agreed to speak with the paper on the 2-year anniversary of her mayorship in Yokohama City. About the city's response to radiation issues arising from the nuclear plant accident, "We have appealed safety for Yokohama. I think we've done our best". About the construction of the new city hall building, she thinks "Upgrade of the Ward Offices should have the priority".
 　－この二年で達成できたことは。
 - What have you achieved in the two years in office?
 　認可保育所の待機児童は、多様な取り組みをして、前年比３７％減となった。産科専用の電話相談の開設や、小児救急電話の二十四時間化など医療環境の充実の約束も着実にできた。市民に喜んでもらえるのではないか。
 37% reduction of the number of children on the waiting list at the city-approved nursery schools has been achieved. Telephone consultation for obstetrics and the 24-hour hot-line for emergency pediatrics have been set up, resulting in substantial improvement in medical environment. I hope city residents are pleased.
 　－小学校給食で、放射性物質に汚染された餌を食べた牛の肉が提供され、「対応が後手」と批判がある。
 - Beef from cows that had been fed with contaminated feed was served in elementary school lunches. Some criticize the city for being "behind the curve" on the problem.
 　後手に回ったとは思ってない。最も恐れたのは、放射線に対する漠然とした不安の広がり。正しい情報や知識を伝えるのが必要と考え、そこに専心した。過度の対応は逆に、市民に不安を与える。風評被害は、避けなければならない。
 I don't think so. What we feared most was the spread of vague fear of radiation. We thought it necessary to spread the correct information and knowledge, and we focused on that. Excessive reaction would cause anxiety among city residents. We have to avoid "baseless rumors".
 　－新しい市庁舎建設の方向性は。
 - About the construction of the new city hall?
 　市庁舎は築五十年で老朽化している。部屋も狭く、機能も民間のビルに分散化し、市民サービスの低下につながる。新市庁舎は絶対必要。二〇一三年度までに基本計画を策定する目標はきちっとやる。ただ、優先順位は区役所の耐震性確保。東日本大震災で書棚が倒れるなど、業務が滞る区役所があった。
 The city hall is is 50-year-old and deteriorating. Rooms are too small, and departments are housed in different private buildings leading to a lower quality of service for the residents. We absolutely must have the new city hall. Our goal is to come up with the base plan by the fiscal 2013. However, the priority should go to the earthquake retrofit of the Special Ward Offices. During the earthquake of March 11, there were some Ward Offices whose service was interrupted because of fallen bookshelves.
 　－今後の課題は。
 - What are the challenges?
 　（原発事故の）風評被害で（外国人などの）観光客が激減したが、集客をやっていく。横浜は観光資源にあふれているが、活用し切れてない。観光都市としては、まだ出来上がっていない。多様な芸術のコンテンツを増やしたい。
 Because of the baseless rumors (of the nuclear plant accident), the number of (foreign) tourists to Yokohama has dropped dramatically. We want them back. Yokohama is full of tourism resources but they are not fully utilized. Yokohama hasn't yet been fully developed as tourist destination. I would like to increase the contents of various arts.
Her idea of correct information about radioactive beef served in schools was to repeat over and over again that she firmly believed it was safe because "it was sold in the market". When the news of potentially contaminated cows reached her, she apparently said "it's only the surface, and inside (meat) is OK". After the cesium beef was actually discovered, the usual "no health effect" mantra was repeated.In addition to the big construction project (City Hall), she is also doing a small "upgrade" of her official residence, to the tune of $220,000, paid for by Yokohama residents.
 It would never occur to her (as it hasn't to most of the country) that the best way to have foreign tourists back again is to deal with radiation and radiation contamination issues openly, with numbers. No one would be willing to risk their health no matter how people like her scream "It's safe, it is below the national provisional safety limit, no effect on health, if you worry you'll get radiation disease".
 In Mayor Hayashi's case, if Yokohama has a lively art scene, foreign tourists will flock to the city.
 (Well, young Chinese couples may still come, thinking they would conceive boys. )
 A fish rots from the head, and the head is still very important in a place like Japan where many ordinary people still look up to the top for leadership, wisdom, knowledge, or whatever virtue they think the "leaders" possess.

Wild Mushroom in Fukushima Tested 28,000 Becquerels/kg of Radioactive Cesium

"It's not food any more, it's simply radioactive materials", as the young man at the Citizen's Radioactivity Measuring Station in Fukushima City said of the radioactive mushroom in Germany's ZDF program aired on August 9.
 Wild mushroom harvested in a town in Fukushima tested highest ever radioactive cesium so far in food after the Fukushima I Nuke Plant accident that I'm aware of: 28,000 becquerels per kilogram.
 According to the data from Fukushima Prefecture, 13,000 becquerels/kg of cesium-134, and 15,000 becquerels/kg of cesium-137 were detected from the mushroom.
 The town, Tanakura-machi, is located at about 73 kilometers southwest of Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant.
 From Yomiuri Shinbun (9/3/2011):
福島県は３日、同県棚倉町の山林で採取した野生のチチタケから、国の暫定規制値（１キロ・グラム当たり５００ベクレル）を大幅に上回る２万８０００ベクレルの放射性セシウムが検出されたと発表した。
 Fukushima Prefecture announced on September 3 that 28,000 becquerels/kg of radioactive cesium was detected from wild mushroom, Lactarius volemus, harvested in the mountains in Tanakura-machi. The level of radioactive cesium vastly exceeds the national provisional safety limit of 500 becquerels/kg.
 　チチタケはシーズン初めのため、市場に流通しているものはないが、県は同日、同町や販売業者に、チチタケを含む野生キノコ（菌根菌類）の摂取と出荷を自粛するよう通知した。
 It is still early in the season for this particular mushroom and it is not sold in the market. The prefectural government notified the town and the distributors to voluntarily halt harvesting and shipping of wild mushrooms including  Lactarius volemus.
 　県によると、このチチタケは１日に採取された。県は今後、付近の野生キノコの放射性物質検査を行うとともに、摂取自粛を呼びかける看板の設置などを行う。
 According to the prefectural government, the mushroom was harvested on September 1. The government is going to test the mushrooms nearby for radioactive materials, and put up signs calling for voluntary halt on harvesting.
 　同県では、これまで野生のキノコで暫定規制値を超えたのは、同県古殿町のチチタケの３２００ベクレルが最高値で、県は「ここだけ突然高い値が出たので困惑している。調査を続けて原因を調べたい」としている。
 In Fukushima Prefecture, 3,200 becquerels/kg of radioactive cesium has been detected from Lactarius volemus harvested in Furudono-machi. The prefectural government says, "We are surprised at the extremely high number. We will continue to investigate and identify the cause".

A Solitary Farmer in Tomioka-Machi: "I'll Never Leave, I'll Never Be Beaten"

AP News reported on August 31 about Mr. Naoto Matsumura, who refuses to leave his home and his farm in Tomioka-machi, which lies in the no-entry evacuation zone within the 20 kilometer radius from Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant. His family has farmed in that location for 5 generations.
 "I'll never be beaten", he says. If he wants to stay, it's his right to do so, he also says.

Radioactive Materials Dispersion Model by Kyushu University Researchers

Using the supercomputer program called SPRINTARS, researchers at Kyushu University and Tokyo University created the simulation of how radioactive materials from Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant may have dispersed throughout the northern hemisphere. The researcher say their simulation fit the actual measurements.
 It was published in the Scientific Online Letters on the Atmosphere (SOLA) under the title "A numerical simulation of global transport of atmospheric particles emitted from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant" in June.
 You can read the paper at this link (PDF file).
 You can also view the animation, here, and the press release in Japanese here.
 Their simulation also shows, like France's CEREA, radioactive materials from March 14/15 release reached the west coast of North America on March 18. The researchers attribute the rapid dispersion of radioactive materials from Fukushima to the unusually strong jet stream. Also, on March 14/15, there was a low pressure on the east cost of Japan, which created a strong updraft that lifted the radioactive materials to the jet stream.
 The relative scale is set with the density of radioactive materials at Fukushima I Nuke Plant as 1. By the time it reached North America, it was between 0.000001 and 0.00000001.

AP: "Quake risk to reactors greater than thought"

"Gov't says 27 US reactors could be more vulnerable to earthquakes than previously thought", according to the article on 9/2/2011.
 From AP:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- The risk that an earthquake would cause a severe accident at a U.S. nuclear plant is greater than previously thought, 24 times as high in one case, according to an AP analysis of preliminary government data. The nation's nuclear regulator believes a quarter of America's reactors may need modifications to make them safer.
 The threat came into sharp focus last week, when shaking from the largest earthquake to hit Virginia in 117 years appeared to exceed what the North Anna nuclear power plant northwest of Richmond was built to sustain.
 The two North Anna reactors are among 27 in the eastern and central U.S. that a preliminary Nuclear Regulatory Commission review has said may need upgrades. That's because those plants are more likely to get hit with an earthquake larger than the one their design was based on. Just how many nuclear power plants are more vulnerable won't be determined until all operators recalculate their own seismic risk based on new assessments by geologists, something the agency plans to request later this year. The NRC on Thursday issued a draft of that request for public comment.
 The review, launched well before the East Coast quake and the Japan nuclear disaster in March, marks the first complete update to seismic risk in years for the nation's 104 existing reactors, despite research showing greater hazards.
 The NRC and the industry say reactors are safe as they are, for now. The average risk to U.S. reactors of core damage from a quake remains low, at one accident every 500 years, according to the AP analysis of NRC data.
 The overall risk at a typical reactor among the 27 remains very slight. If the NRC's numbers prove correct, that would mean no more than one core accident from an earthquake in about 30,000 years at the typical reactor among the 27 with increased risk.
 But emails obtained in a more than 11,000-page records request by The Associated Press show that NRC experts were worried privately this year that plants needed stronger safeguards to account for the higher risk assessments.
 (The article continues.)What's more interesting than the article is the comment section. Here are some:
- I am suspicious of the anti-nuclear propaganda like this article. Not one person died due to the Japanese nuclear problem. Millions of people die worldwide each year due to pollution from coal and oil fired power plants. ... Nuclear power does not produce CO2. It is the ONLY source powerful enough to supply our modern world. Solar and wind are great - but much too small a source. ...The hysteria over nuclear must stop. Every power source has its problems. Nuclear will not kill the five or six billion eventually that scientists say will happen with increasing CO2.
 - That's right- Hack Journalist! Blow Me AP! You fear mongoring POS! DIE AP!
 - So a bunch of hack journalists read a bunch of government emails and that makes them nuclear engineers?Give me a freaking break!You can read the rest of the comments at the link.

August 2011 Net Monthly Job Added in the US: Zero, ゼロ, Cero, Null,

The last time when this happened, according to the news report, was August of 1945, when the World War II finally ended with the surrender of the imperial Japan.
 From MSNBC (9/2/2011):
Employment growth ground to a halt in August, as sagging consumer confidence discouraged already skittish U.S. businesses from hiring, keeping pressure on the Federal Reserve to provide more monetary stimulus to aid the struggling economy.
 Nonfarm payrolls were unchanged last month, the Labor Department said Friday. It was the first time since 1945 that the government has reported a net monthly job change of zero. The August payrolls report was the worst since September 2010, while nonfarm employment for June and July was revised to show 58,000 fewer jobs.
 (The article continues.)
According to the article, while the number may look bad, it's all because of striking Verizon workers (45,000 people).
 President Obama had no comment, and at 10AM departed for his presidential retreat at Camp David for the Labor Day weekend (of all weekends..). (That's all he did today.)He must be preparing for his big speech on jobs to be delivered on the NFL opening night next week, no doubt.If that doesn't do anything (I doubt it does), there's Ben and his QE3 to the rescue. (Just don't ask rescue what?)

Wild Lily That Has Really Gone Wild in Saitama City

 I know there will be many who will tell me they've seen something like this before, or it's just a normal variation, happens all the time, etc.. If you do, please send the pictures of this happening elsewhere.
 The picture was taken by a person who lives nearby, and it was on Yomiuri Shinbun Saitama version (9/1/2011). A normal lily is on the right side. The giant lily is about 1 meter tall, according to Yomiuri.

Fall Semester in Fukushima Starts with Glass Badges for Children

that quietly monitor the radiation levels. Their teacher hopes the badges "will protect the children".
 (Oh boy...)
 From NHK News Japanese (9/1/2011):
福島市の小中学校で、１日、２学期の始業式が行われ、子どもたちに線量計が配られました。
 The fall semester started on September 1 in elementary schools and junior high schools in Fukushima City, and children received their glass badges.
 福島市の小中学校では、１日から２学期が始まり、福島第一小学校でも午前７時すぎから子どもたちが登校し始めました。福島市では、一部の地域で高い放射線量が計測され、学校の校庭や通学路で放射線量を下げる対策が進められていますが、１日はマスク姿の子どもが目立ち、正門前には子どもを送る保護者の車の列が出来ていました。
 At Fukushima Daiichi Elementary School, children started arriving at 7AM. High radiation has been measured in certain areas in Fukushima City, and the measures to lower the radiation levels in the school yards and on the routes to schools [children usually walk to school] are being taken. But on the first day of the school, many children wore masks, and many parents drove their children to school to the front gate of the school.
 始業式では、福井一明校長が「みんなが元気に登校して２学期がスタートでき、うれしく思います。楽しい学校生活を送って下さい」とあいさつしました。福島県では、２学期から１５歳未満の子ども２８万人に放射線の線量計が配られることになっていて、始業式のあと教室に戻った子どもたちは担任の教師から線量計を受け取り、登下校の際に首からかけることなど使い方の説明を受けていました。
 During the start of the school ceremony, Principal Kazuaki Fukui greeted the children, saying "I am glad that you are all here in good health to start the fall semester. Enjoy your school life". In Fukushima Prefecture, 280,000 children younger than 15 years are to receive the glass badges to monitor radiation. After the ceremony, children received the badges from their classroom teachers, and were told to wear the badge from the neck on the way to and from school.
 線量計を受け取った子どもたちは「これで少しは安心できます」とか「首にぶら下げると少し変な感じがします」などと話していました。６年生の担当の教師は「線量計を子どもたちに身に着けさせるのは心苦しい気もするが、安全を確保するためのお守りだと考えています。例年よりも日焼けした子どもたちの姿が少ないように感じたので、２学期はなるべく外で遊ばせたいと思います」と話していました。
 On receiving the badges, children said "I feel a bit safer now", or "it feels funny when I wear it around my neck". A teacher in charge of 6th graders said, "I feel sorry that children have to wear the glass badges, but I consider the badges as amulets that protect children. It looks to me that there are fewer children with sun tan this year, so I would like to have them play outdoors as much as possible."DON'T!!! In the accompanying video at the NHK page, the teacher says he hopes "it will be the normal fall semester, just like last year".
 Higher education doesn't necessarily mean higher intelligence, that's for sure. (Probably inversely correlated, when I look at Japan.) And trading on hope is not a viable strategy either.

Goshi Hosono, Minister in Charge of Fukushima Accident to Become the Minister of the Environment

The Ministry of the Environment is going to oversee the Nuclear Safety Agency to be created next year. Hosono continues to be the minister in charge of the Fukushima nuclear accident under the new prime minister Yoshihiko Noda.
 The Minister of Foreign Affairs is Koichiro Genba, whose last notable remark I remember was "Let's all cheer for TEPCO".

OT: Japanese Politician Tried to Bribe with Rice

The Fukushima I Nuke Plant accident may be changing the long tradition of vote buying in Japanese politics.
 Yomiuri Shinbun (9/1/2011) reports that an assemblyman in Nara City in Nara Prefecture was privately asked by the assembly chairman in June to vote in a certain way in the upcoming election of the new assembly chairman. He refused. Then the chairman said to him, "What if I gave you rice for 5 years?" He declined, but recorded the conversation with his smart phone.
 Well, rice was used as a medium of exchange in Japan until the Meiji Restoration knocked out the Tokugawa Shogun government. Rice may have become more valuable, particularly if it is radionuclide-free, than the fiat money they have in Japan. (Personally I think the assemblyman should have taken up the offer...)

Yet Another Government Survey of Fukushima Evacuation Zones

Now it's METI (Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry)'s turn to announce its radiation survey of air radiation (at 1 meter and 1 centimeter) of Fukushima evacuation zones, showing the highest air radiation of 139 microsieverts/hour at 1 meter off the ground (in a location in Okuma-machi, 1.5 kilometer southwest of the plant), and 368 microsieverts/hour at 1 centimeter (in a location in Futaba-machi, 4 kilometers west of the plant).
 The radiation level at the location in Okuma-machi with 138 microsieverts/hour radiation at 1 meter off the ground is 201 microsieverts/hour at 1 centimeter.
 The radiation level at the location in Futaba-machi with 368 microsieverts/hr radiation at 1 centimeter off the ground is only 63.8 microsieverts/hour at 1 meter.
 The Ministry of Education and Science and the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries have already announced their own surveys of soil contamination levels in Fukushima Prefecture, just as the national government is allowing the temporary return of residents whose homes are within the 3-kilometer radius from the plant.
 Now, is somebody going to combine all three and create a map that shows air radiation and soil contamination of each location? (Just saying.)
 METI's survey was done in July in the no-entry evacuation zone within the 20-kilometer radius and the planned evacuation zone outside the 20-kilometer radius.
 From the METI press release on 9/1/2011 (Japanese only):
 1. Air radiation levels at 1 meter off the ground:
 2. Air radiation level at 1 centimeter off the ground: The press release doesn't contain all the detailed data for each municipalities.

Simulation Map of Cesium-137 Deposition Across the Pacific by CEREA Shows Contamination in US Greater Than That of Western Japan

France's CEREA has the simulation map of ground deposition of cesium-137 from the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant accident on its "Fukushima" page. It not only shows Japan but also the entire northern Pacific Rim, from Russian Siberia to Alaska to the West Coast of the US to the entire US.
 According to the map, the US, particularly the West Coast and particularly California, may be more contaminated with radioactive cesium than the western half of Japan or Hokkaido. It looks more contaminated than South Korea or China. Canada doesn't look too well either, particularly along the border with US on the western half.
 From CEREA's Fukushima page:
Atmospheric dispersion of radionuclides from the Fukushima-Daichii nuclear power plant  CEREA, joint laboratory École des Ponts ParisTech and EdF R&D Victor Winiarek, Marc Bocquet, Yelva Roustan, Camille Birman, Pierre Tran  Map of ground deposition of caesium-137 for the Fukushima-Daichii accident.  The simulation was performed with a specific version of the numerical atmospheric chemistry and transport model Polyphemus/Polair3D. The parametrisations used for the transport and physical removal of the radionuclides are described in [1,2,3,4].  The magnitude of the deposition field is uncertain and the simulated values of deposited radionuclides could be significantly different from the actual deposition. In particular, the source term remains uncertain. Therefore, these results should be seen as preliminary and they are likely to be revised as new information become available to better constrain the source term and when radionuclides data can be used to evaluate the model simulation results. The page also has the animated simulation of cesium-137 dispersion from March 11 to April 6, 2011. If the Japanese think they are the only ones who have the radiation and radioactive fallout from the accident, they are very much mistaken, if the simulation is accurate. (Meteorological institutes and bureaus in Austria, Germany, and Norway all had similar simulation maps.)
 Radioactive materials spewed out of Fukushima I Nuke Plant went up and away on the jet stream, reaching the other side of the Pacific. When the fallout from explosions (March 14, 15) reached the US West Coast, it came with an unusually heavy rainfall in California.CEREA's description of the animation (if the animation doesn't work, or if you want to see the bigger one, go to CEREA's page):Movie of the Fukushima-Daichii activity in the air (caesium-137, ground level)The simulation was performed with a specific version of the numerical atmospheric chemistry and transport model Polyphemus/Polair3D.

Fukushima Children vs Government Bureaucrats on Aug 17, 2011 (Video)

The showdown of some sort happened on August 17 in a meeting set up by the Fukushima Network for Saving Children from Radiation, between the 4 children from Fukushima Prefecture and the junior bureaucrats from the national government.
 It was widely disseminated in Japan and abroad when that happened, and many people were rightly appalled at the pathetically bureaucratic answers of these bureaucrats (what else could you expect?) to the children.
 Tokyo Brown Tabby translated the exchange and put the caption on the video. This is the first half of the event. The second half, where the officials answer the children, is being translated by Tabby and will be ready shortly.
   Children were reported to be very disappointed and hurt by the non-answers from the bureaucrats, which were totally expected (or should have been expected by the organizers to begin with).
 Personally I have a mixed feeling. This remindｓ me of the Fukushima peach PR campaign the other day by the Fukushima junior high school students on their school trip to Yokohama City. The fruit growers use children to push their belief (that what they produce is safe), and the non-profit organizations against nuclear power also use children to push their belief (that the government should do everything to protect Fukushima children from radiation).
 And who are hurt by the negative response or experience? Children.

#Fukushima I Nuke Plant: Water Entombment Is Back on the Table

Remember the time when the TEPCO/government complex pretended that it would fill the Containment Vessels of Reactors 1, 2 and 3 with water to cool the Reactor Pressure Vessels inside? It was late April, TEPCO started to pour an enormous amount of water in the RPV of Reactor 1 to fill the Vessel (as the water would leak into the CV). The operation was dubbed "water entombment".
 We know how it quickly ended. TEPCO finally managed to actually measure the water level inside the CV and RPV of Reactor 1, and found that there was hardly any water in either of them - i.e. both the CV and the RPV of Reactor 1 were broken, kaput. Of 10,000 tonnes of water that TEPCO poured into the CV of Reactor 1, 3,000 tonnes were discovered in the basement.
 But now, the water entombment is back in discussion in conjunction with decommissioning the reactors at Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant, according to Mainichi Shinbun (8/31/2011).
 According to Mainichi, the plan submitted by TEPCO to a special committee of the Nuclear Safety Commission calls for the following steps:
Clean up highly radioactive debris inside the reactor buildings;Identify and repair the damage to the Containment Vessels and the reactor buildings;Fill the Containment Vessels with water;Open the top lid of the Reactor Pressure Vessels and remove the melted fuel.The NSC committee will consider the plan, and the government will decide on the final plan by January 2012.
 My questions:
 Step No.1: How? By whom?
Step No.2: How? By whom?
Step No.3: What's the point again?
Step No.4: What melted fuel?
 And no one knows, or rather, no one cares or wants to know, where exactly these melted blobs of fuel rods, control rods, instruments, metals, etc., are right now. TEPCO and the government will proceed as if they remain at the bottom of the Containment Vessel of each Reactor, if not still within the RPV.
 Inside the reactor buildings there are at least several spots as identified by TEPCO where the radiation levels are measured in sieverts/hour. Who is going to do the cleanup work, not to mention repairing the CVs and the building (I suppose they are thinking about the concrete foundations)?
