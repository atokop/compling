@Covert Dad, when you gripe that "That's not very funny to the people in Mineral whose homes were destroyed," I think you actually meant person, not people.  There was only one house in all of Mineral that had any significant damage.  And no one was seriously hurt.  Unless you consider a crappy drop ceiling a person  Seriously, in the way of "disasters", this is about the mildest disaster that's happened in quite some time.  But since DC is the nexus of the universe, according to folks like you, it gets a lot of press.http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/nationnow/2011/08/at-the-epicenter-mineral-va...

yeah... I keep seeing this pic being passed around, and you know, it would be a lot funnier if we weren't just a couple miles from the epicenter, with a collapsed chimney and broken furnishings... it will actually take us a long time to rebuild our 1890's farmhouse but for everyone farther away from it, yeah, this is pretty accurate.

Frank Surber (Facebook) responded:

Lindsay the picture is not to say that there was no damage near the actual epicenter everyone pretty much has taken the picture to refer how just seconds after the quake all of the chicken littles ran out of the government buildings like the world was coming to an end. The picture is meant to portray how inept the government would truly be in a real crisis.Y.i Song it wouldn't matter if the pic was dated 50 years ago its portrayal and comments about the government and DC proper are pretty much spot on.

**BREAKING NEWS**: The Weather Channel says yesterdays east coast earthquake was caused by an unknown fault line running under D.C. and through Virginia. Theorists are still indecisive as to whether it is Obama's Fault or Bush's Fault and are contemplating another theory, saying that it may be the founding fathers rolling over in their graves. Lastly, the possibility remains that the earthquake may just be the effects of a 14.6 trillion dollar check bouncing in Washington.
