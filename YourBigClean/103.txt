NOM speaker blames East Coast earthquake on gays

Posted on 08.24.11

Within hours of an earthquake striking the eastern U.S. Tuesday, a rabbi that has spoken for the anti-gay group National Organization for Marriage (NOM) was already blaming homosexuals.
In a video posted to YouTube, Rabbi Yehuda Levin asserted that “one of the reasons God brings earthquakes to the world is because of the transgressions of homosexuality.”
“An email went out in my community just a few hours ago, ‘How long will it take Rabbi Levin to tie this earthquake in with homosexual marriage?’” he began. “Not very long at all. I’m happy to see that people — even if some of them are scoffers — are starting to see the connection.”
“Yes, there is a direct connection between earthquakes and homosexuality. There was in Haiti and it is here, in New York, in Washington, D.C., where they passed homosexual legislation ordinances, in New York City and state, where they opened, especially on Sunday early, where they passed the homosexual marriage law.”
Levin continued: “We want everyone to understand that if this kinds of activities continue and are legislated into the moral fiber of the country and are forced down the throats of the religious people, it’s a revolt against God. And literally, there’s hell to pay. 
The blog Good As You noted that in June, Levin had spoken during a NOM press conference.

Sooooo, like Haiti and Japan (not to mention major hotbeds of seismic activity like Turkey or Afghanistan or China) are being punished for their tolerant gay-rights policies? Who knew?!?
btw, anyone ever notice how the ‘phobes like to portray equality as being “forced down” their “throats?” It’s become such a meme for them. And it’s only ever used in objection to equal rights for gays. It’s never used in a racial or ethnic context. I think there is some underlying fantasy issue going on with these peeps.

They should rename their organization from NOM to NOB – National Organization of Bigots. These are not people of God.

Daniel Borysewicz

I will pray for him. God loves all people, regardless of who or what they are. But I can understand his reasoning – the God of the Hebrew Bible was not written as a very loving God. Smiting people repeatedly and then there was that story about the ark. But that had nothing to do with homosexuality because angels came down and had sex with women and created ‘wicked creatures’.

Amazing how these acts of God always look like natural disasters. For once I would like to see a rain of flaming brimstone hit one of these so called areas of immorality and smite only the wicked rather than everyone equally. If ,for example, New York was hit with a rain of flaming sulpher that only burned adulterers or murderers andÂ left everyone else and their propertyÂ unscathed,Â Â I think that would be really damned impressive.

Rabbi, you should gobble a kilo or two of Xanax super Tranqs, then a razor and get rid of that kootie ranch on your face. Â Aftwards you might visit Amazon, Borders, Powells Books and get yourself a couple of Geography, History, and Science books to get your life back on track. Â 
You and your effin Gawd!!! Â What a effing joke you and others like you with such incredibly shallow minds are. Â How in the fuck did you ever make it past puberty? Â For sure you know nothing! Â Haiti being one of the poorest countries in the world has to build with what is available, or with what is given to them. Â I don’t imagine Israel contributes very much to their welfare so they probably do pretty much without. Â As for Japan, most of the literate world realize that they are on a major fault line called the Ring of Fire. Â No, it has nothing to do with that imaginary Hell that all of the Religious Fundie Dumb Fucks talk about all the time. Â  Perhaps if you would have used your spare time in studying Science or Math or some subject other than Superstition, Prejudice, Ignorance, Intolerance and all those fine human traits that are taught by Religions of all peoples, you might rid yourself of that Silly fucking hat and other idiotic vestments that you doofuses wear, Â and truly find peace within.
I and hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people who are of the same opinion all agree that one of the biggest problems in the world today is the spread of ignorance, intolerance and superstitions. Â All in the name of Religion…..
Just think how much farther we could have traveled forward in history without all the crap caused by you and those like you… Â  Religion is a blight, a disease, and something that if we are going to possibly continue on this or any world, we need to rid ourselves of….
Please spare us the agony of reading your bigotry and ignorance and crawl back under that pile of shit that you live under and feed off of…Â

Let’s see if we can understand this – God made gays so that he can hate them. Does this mean that god then hates the things he creates, which are, of course, all of his own doing. Therefore, is god just a sick fuck with a very twisted sense of humor or just plan irrational?

Bad gay fish! And that heat wave and drought in Texas and Oklahoma… that’s God punishing everybody in Texas for electing assholes like Perry and Inhofe, and not smothering Bush in his crib!

Â As a STRAIGHT MALE who believes in our CONSTITUTION, the only hell I am living in is RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW, having to endure the IGNORANCE of so many WORMS (weak, overzealous religious, morons) in our society. I often wonder how it is, that it is not enough to have and believe in one’s own religIon.Â Then they have to force others to listen to their retoricÂ so all can be saved on their particular DAY of RECKONING, WHEN EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT BECAUSE RELIGEON IS IN FACT A PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP TO ONE’S OWN GOD, IT WILL BE THEM THAT WILL HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO THEIR INDIVIDUAL HIGHER POWER, GOD, OR SPIRITUAL BEING, THE DECISIONS AND LIFESTYLE THEY LEAD WHILE ON THIS PLAIN.
I also truly believe that especially when each one of these HOMOPHOBE rabbi’s, priests, reverends, and/or other religeous WORMS dies and stands before their respective higher power, they will be denied entrance to heaven for two reasons.
1. for trying to CONVERT through intimidation, fear, and ignorance.
2. for not having the COMPASSION FOR THEIR FELLOW HUMAN BEINGS, BUT judgement against them, which sends people straight to hell anyway.

Well, it’s nice to know that so-called-Christians haven’t cornered the market on bigoted stupidity.
Although you really do have to wonder, if he thinks DC declaring gay marriage legal only warranted a 5.9 earthquake, what did the God-fearing homophobes across the Middle East–of all races and faiths–do to deserve what’s been happening to them there for, say, the last 3000 years?
Come to think of it, by his logic the most pious and loved-by-God people on earth must be the folks who live on pleasant little Pacific island chains with year-round beautiful weather, bountiful fruits of the earth in abundance, and almost no natural disasters.

If i may be permitted to mince some words: You are mistaken. The definition of a verb does not apply to the definition of an adjective.Â  Perhaps you are ignorant of the fact that the word “Ignorance” does not necessarily imply WILLFUL disregard of “something”. Â It is defined as Â a state of being uninformed (lack of knowledge). The word “ignorant” is an adjective describing a person in the state of being unaware and is often used as an insult.

Thanks, Jill. Actually, I like to mince words; it’s one of my favorite avocations, along with occasional out-and-out word butchery.
I understand the seeming difference between ignore and ignorant but I tend to callously toss it aside because I see it as yet another erosion of intent. The adjectival suffix “ant” is used to indicate a specific state or condition, in this case it refers to the verb ignore, hence ignorant is the state of ignoring. I hold, perhaps anally, to the root meaning. Languages are in constant flux, meanings shift with time unless they are anchored down, the transmogrification of awe into awful being a good example. I am fighting for my meaning-I find ignorant as I prefer it to be defined as very useful. Specifically, it is up to a person to be responsible for his level of understanding; the law agrees with me on this: Ignorantia juris non excusat. 
I don’t consider cavemen to have been ignorant of Newton’s Laws of Gravity, though they were obligated to obey them just the same. They were not part of the cultural knowledge. For us they are a commonplace. Assuming a person was of reasonable intelligence and had reasonable access to the information I would expect that person to understand the concept, though not necessarily (and most likely not) the formulae. Someone of the above description who didn’t understand the basic concept of gravity I would consider to be ignorant in a pejorative sense. More relevant examples of ignorance, or as BrainRag said, willful ignorance, would be those who deny evolution, or believe that the Earth is motionless in the center of space and the universe revolves around it once every 24 hours (that would be 40% and 20% of Americans respectively!) I will continue to call them ignorant and I will continue to use the word in a pejorative manner. If enough people side with me, the meaning will pick up more of the flavor I desire. I realize at best mine is a quixotic journey but in the end perhaps they are the most rewarding. 
Hopefully I have not appeared arrogant or snooty; neither were my intent. If, however that was the case please forgive my failings.

Paladino was a Democrat for 34 years, he endorsed Democrat candidates as recently as 2009; one year before he ran as a Republican.

If homosexuals are causing earthquakes, maybe they should be should have sex at different times of the day. If the earth is moving for too many people at the same time, it obviously moves for all of us. Gays, stops having sex all at the same time. I think that is what he is trying to say.

Here’s the thing most people miss about this type of story and many other wacko religious based tales; if a person is willing to give up his or her own ability to reason and think rationally by believing in a god then that type of personÂ quite possibly would beÂ willing to believe anything.
Buy the god idea and I can sell you almost anything. The snake oil salesman of the past knew and used the theory behind this quite successfully.
God and heaven are the snake oil and all one has to do to reap theÂ cure is…….die. Religion is the vehicle that carries the snake oil and preachers are the pusher men of that elixirÂ to the peasants.
Mind you all that are believers; I am not saying everyone that believes is this way but far too many are although everyone that does believe has to abandon reason and rationality to a degree.
That saidÂ when it comes to whacked out religious people perhaps one bad apple may very well spoil the whole bushel. The rooting NOMÂ written about in this article is in that basket.

Theres an important lesson here…and its that religions…all of them…not just evangelical xians…lend themselves to the support of batshit morons just by virtue of their existence. At the core of it…it comes down to belief without evidence…the state of being comfortable with a system of beliefs that has no tangible root in reality. Once you make that leap, anything, no matter how cockamamie or idiotic, becomes a short step away from being believable.
There are lots of very kind, very reasonable people who have a religious faith…and their basic decency curbs the tendency to vest lots of time and effort into the ridiculous. I’m glad they’re out there making their faiths better and I wish them well…but I’d be even happier if they laid aside fantasy-land and comforting fairy tales and joined in putting a complete stop to nutters like the above.

Pretty typical reaction of the Chosen Plague…People that is.Â  Here are similar reactions from some of his brethren:
“Hurricane Katrina is a punishment meted out by God as a result of U.S. President George W. Bushâs support for the Gaza and northern West Bank disengagement.
In his weekly sermon, the rabbi said: âThere was a tsunami and there are terrible natural disasters, because there isnât enough Torah studyâŚ black people reside there (in New Orleans). Blacks will study the Torah? (God said) letâs bring a tsunami and drown them.â
Â âHundreds of thousands remained homeless. Tens of thousands have been killed. All of this because they have no God,â said the rabbi, who already found himself in hot water in the past following controversial remarks of one kind or another.”- Israel’s Shas spiritual leader Ovadia Yosef

serve him. They are always of two classes: fools and hypocrites.”

The real question is who didn’t think Gays caused the Quake? I mean how obvious can it get

Jews are usually a little more science oriented but there are batshit crazies in every religion.

My feelings on organizedÂ  religion have only grown more bitter, and I do try to temper it with respect to those who choose to follow any of them. This Rabbi or any other Clergy would be hilarious….if they’re feelings were kept to themselves….but nooooooooo they need followers, excuses, and constant assurance they are right. My own personal feeling is that these people of whatever fanatical bent…..can go fuck themselves.

all I am going to say is this. Â If those gay people have that much power that they can cause earthquakes, I say let them get married and dance naked in the streets. Â Never in the history of man have people had so much power over nature. Â It just scares me to the bone

and furthermore, is a Rabbi really an IslamicÂ Mullah or inman trying to get out or is it vice versa? Â They both hide behind the beard

Did he say “ravishing tsunami’? Orthodoxy over Civil Rights? What if you’re not Jewish?

his head looks like one of those statues on easter island disguised with a beard!

This is really a result of shifting tectonic plates.
Lousy god-hating, socialist, anti-freemarket, tectonic plates.
Someone should declare war on them.

I can’t believe he is a real rabbi.
Now if he had those silly ringlets of hair coming out of his hat,
Â I might be able to take him seriously.

This from a man that insists that desert goat herders living in tents 3000 years ago knew more about the world, life and the universe than modern day scientists.

You just don’t get it Rabbi. God’s still upset with what your people did to his Son. And until it looks half decent, shave off that ratty beard. lol

Rabbi, you got it backward. Earthquakes cause gay behavior. Say you’re in a crowded elevator when one of those babies hit – you’d be surprised as to what can go into what. Gives an entire new meaning to the term “7.0″

One really begins to wonder…. if the religious Morons in this country really believe in an omnipotent Ghod… why can’t they accept the fact that their bullshit ghod caused the Earth to shake?Â  Why do they only attribute the good to him and not all the bad shit their imaginary ‘good sky Daddy’ Â does????Â  Is that all part of their DELUSION, too???Â  Not that I buy into any of that crap….. I know that this Planet was formed 4.5 Billion years ago, and that it’s still alive and changing, hence Earth-Quakes, Volcanoes,Â  Weather, storms & every other facet of nature….that we have no control over. Â But why can’t these assholes throw off their ancient superstitions, now, in the 21st Century, and agreeÂ  that SCIENCE has relegated their ghods to the garbage dump!Â  Remember folks, religion is only about control and dominance.Â  We don’t need it any more… if we want to keep progressing as a species…..

There is no ghod….. and the only mystery to the ‘Immaculate Deception’Â  is………… who was Mary fucking?

Take the Hat off his head, replace it with a Turban, and you’ll find that there’s very little difference between religious fanatics…………

god is such a powerful tool in the hands of people,
who choose to manipulate their fellow men into doing things that serve their personal gain!!!Â 
god is not a mad dog, dont be so frightened ! rabbi!
god is only a word consisting of three characters, it will not hurt you.
there is no need to be so afraid,you can think freely. Â 
âGodâ is a word for reality as a whole, for what transcends us! love!!!
rabbi!Â yehuda levin does not understand the concept âGodâ, while he studied theology âŚ?..Â
