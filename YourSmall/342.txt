Last evening's  earthquake with its epicentre near the border with  Nepal, left a trail of devastation damaging roads, buildings and other structures, uprooting mobile phone towers and snapping communication and power lines.   After shocks made people panic in several areas forcing them to spend the night outdoors.   Union home secretary RK Singh said nothing can be ruled out as people may still be trapped under the debris of collapsed houses since rescue teams were still trying hard to reach all villages.   "The possibility of the the toll going up is there as reports from remote hilly regions, especially in Sikkim, have yet to arrive," Singh said at a press conference.   Meanwhile, over 5,000 troops, six transport aircraft and more than 15 helicopters have been deployed by the armed forces in the affected regions of the state to carry out relief operations.   Two army personnel died in the quake near Zima in north Sikkim while a junior engineer of Border Roads Organisation (BRO) was reported killed during rescue operation, a defence ministry release said here.   "Two MI-17 helicopters of the IAF carried relief material and National Disaster Relief Force (NDRF) to Lachen and Mangan, the interior regions of North Sikkim," it said.   Landslides have cut off army's 112 brigade deployed in the north Sikkim with the rest of the country.   "The road connecting Gangtok with north Sikkim has been cut off at several places. Our three battalions and one battalion of ITBP with over 4,500 men are present in that area," Army sources said.   They said connectivity has been maintained with the formations there through helicopters and work is on to restore the road, which is crucial for reaching the area bordering China.   An alternative route to the area has also been proposed by the Army but the project is not yet finalised due to lack of environmental clearances, the sources said.    Food packets air dropped    Government today started air dropping of food to earthquake-affected people in Sikkim amidst fears that some people may still be trapped under the debris.   Two medical teams with doctors and paramedics reached worst affected Mangan and Sangthan with the help of helicopters and BRO has been able to reopen the state's life line -- the National Highway 31-A.   Sikkim accounted for 41 deaths alone, with most casualties taking place in the North District and in towns and villages like Rangpo, Dikchu, Singtam and Chungthang located along the course of Teesta river, officials in the district control room said.
