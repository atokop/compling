Sikkim Earthquake: What the real estate industry fears most!
We have posted about this a while back. We also found this video footage just hours after the big earthquake hit Sikkim, India, today. Its a very small video but you can feel the fear that the people being interviewed have experienced!
Real estate globally is all about land. And when land shakes, the very foundation of this entire industry is shaken. It is probably, every real estate professional's worst nightmare. Do share your comments and feedback, especially on our Home Insurance India - Peace of mind against earthquakes article posted a while ago.
Take care, people. May God give strength to those affected today.

About Us
After a decade in the real estate industry in India, we realized that the picture was quite muddy for the 'lay' man! Over time, we will try and do our two cents to clear this with varied discussions and articles. The 'Dummies' concept is notional and belongs originally to the creators of that brand. We are just trying to rub in, where we come from! Hope that helps you, as a reader.
