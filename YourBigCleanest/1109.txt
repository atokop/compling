The 2011 East Coast earthquake shook unsuspecting residents from Georgia to New York.

It was surprising because the East Coast does not frequently experience earthquakes strong enough to be felt.

The East Coast earthquake on Aug. 23, 2011 caused no major damage, injuries, or death, according to USA Today.  However, it did spook millions of people, set Twitter ablaze with comments, prompted widespread (but short) evacuations, and caused traffic jams.

The reactions to the earthquake were mostly humorous and incredulous due to the lack of serious consequences.

- Can someone hurry up and make an #obama and #earthquake joke. Its been at least 3 seconds….. 

- Earthquake scared me SO bad at work today..cool experience but pretty terrifying

The 5.8-magitude earthquake struck a location 38 miles outside of Richmond, Va. at 1:51 p.m. ET, according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).  It occurred in the previously known Central Virginia Seismic Zone, which has produced small tremors since at least the 18th century.

In 2003, a 4.5 magnitude earthquake also caused some minor damage.

The USGS stated that “earthquakes in the central and eastern U.S., although less frequent than in the western U.S., are typically felt over a much broader region.”
