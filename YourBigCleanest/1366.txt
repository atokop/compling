Although it seems hilarious this really desensitizes you to what happened. A 5.9 earthquake did hit Virginia, and DC was not the center of it. Take a look at the google map: http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.9746+-77.9689%28M5.9+-+VIRGINIA+-+2011+Augus...,-77.9689&spn=2,2&f=d&t=h&hl=eTake a look at the area map:http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/pager/events/us/c0005ild/index.html

It'd be funny if this guy didn't steal this from someone else that posted it after the Indiana quake last year.

Umm thanks to the people that are just trying to be nice, but the rest of you that were in the quake area...you guys are retarded. I live in this area and that quake was barely more than an off balance washer.  Try not to over complicate your day or be greedy for attention. Find something more productive to do.

That chair is defective! Failed to withstand the meerest earthquake testing. Send it back to China for remelting.

Ok, I thought to jokes about the earthquake today were very insensitive BUT I must say this one got a laugh outta me soooooo....Here's my funny comment (in my CNN reporter voice)OMG!!!!!  That patch of grass under the chair will NEVER recover!!!!!

Reminds me of that '30 Rock' episode where they pre-recorded telethons for every conceivable disaster. Do you think they had one for DC earthquakes?

you can get the t-shithttp://www.zazzle.com/i_survived_the_east_coast_megaquake_2011_tshirt-2351704...

Breaking news; Obama had to cancel a campaign speech to deal with the Earthquake crisis in DC , when the chair fell over it landed on the power cord to his teleprompter and unplugged it. More news @ 11

Fabulous pic! I've added it to a collection of other 'devastation' picks: https://www.facebook.com/GreatEarthquake

I'd been in bigger and stronger earthquakes like from 6.8 and more, is so silly the big fuzz everybody was doing at WA and VA.. people running scared, lol.... the news were posting like a 3rd world war....I thought it was STUPID!!GOOD JOB coming with this idea and the picture is priceless...hahahaa

Would be funnier if it were accurate.http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bal-earthquake-intensity-map-2011,0...http://www.foxnews.com/us/2011/08/23/washington-monument-indefinitely-closes-...http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/08/24/quake-usa-cathedral-idUSN1E77M1Q620...You get an "A" for snark though!

Congress has just passed a law banning the use of hazardous lawn chairs as a precaution against future earthquakes.

Earthquakes can happen anywhere! You just have to be prepared. http://wp.me/p1DjYf-2t

Looks like a several billion dollar clean up will be required. Then the analysis of this epic tragedy. The earth quake will be called: Obama's Fault.

Umm... funny as it is, but does anybody notice that this picture is dated July 2010?This is not from yesterday's earthquake.. just saying.

Lindsay the picture is not to say that there was no damage near the actual epicenter everyone pretty much has taken the picture to refer how just seconds after the quake all of the chicken littles ran out of the government buildings like the world was coming to an end. The picture is meant to portray how inept the government would truly be in a real crisis.Y.i Song it wouldn't matter if the pic was dated 50 years ago its portrayal and comments about the government and DC proper are pretty much spot on.

I should have more accurately stated that the article was posted on 2010..(I didn't even realize there was an earthquake in 2010 in DC region.) yes 5.9 quake isn't very strong an earthquake (esp to those from West coast), but it did more than flip a lawn chair this time around.. I do find the picture funny, though!

**BREAKING NEWS**: The Weather Channel says yesterdays east coast earthquake was caused by an unknown fault line running under D.C. and through Virginia. Theorists are still indecisive as to whether it is Obama's Fault or Bush's Fault and are contemplating another theory, saying that it may be the founding fathers rolling over in their graves. Lastly, the possibility remains that the earthquake may just be the effects of a 14.6 trillion dollar check bouncing in Washington.

Joe "China In A Bull Sh*p" Biden was axed about the East Coast Earthquake while he was in China and said, "It's Bush's Fault". (sorry)
