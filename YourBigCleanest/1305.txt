The East Coast was rattled Tuesday by a rare earthquake. (more)

There have been at least five aftershocks following Tuesday's east coast earthquake,  including one big one overnight.

The magnitude 4.5 earthquake was centered about 31 miles east of Charlottesville, Virginia. at 1:07 a.m. EST Thursday.

UPDATED ON WEDNESDAY AUGUST 24:  The 5.8-magnitude earthquake Tuesday that shook people from Georgia to Canada has produced at least four aftershocks. The U.S. Geological Survey says the aftershocks around the central Virginia epicenter ranged in magnitude from 4.2 to as little as 2.2 since the strongest earthquake to strike the East Coast since World War II.

Amy Vaughan, a geophysicist with the National Earthquake Information Center in Colorado, says the number of aftershocks so far has been remarkably low. Vaughan says the agency isn't sure what to expect, but it's likely there will be some more for days, if not weeks. Typically, the larger the quake, the longer and the greater extent of aftershocks.
