"Hey! Stop kicking my fuckin' bench! Stop kickin' my bench!" That's how I first noticed yesterday's 5.8 earthquake in Virginia, sitting in Tompkins Square Park eating my lunch, with an obviously disturbed homeless man trying to sleep a few benches down. 

My bench was shaking too, feeling like someone was excessively into their music and taping out the beat. But with no one obviously rocking out nearby I immediately wondered if it was an earthquake. Apparently I was a minute faster than the internet, as my iPhone search yielded no recent results for 'earthquake NYC 2011'. 

I guessed New York just got a perhaps a 4.0 quake, but 5.8 in Virginia must feel like that several hundred miles away. In any case, it felt less strong to me than being woken in a Mumbai hotel by the 7.7 Gujarat earthquake in 2001.

This video of the seismic waves below is beyond a doubt cool on the face of it (I was going to share it with you all before Jaymi beat me to it), but if it was caption "Twitter waves move across the nation after rare Virginia quake" you'd probably believe me for a second. After all Twitter hit 5,500 tweets per second at the height of it all.

Jumping on the bandwagon of highlighting nuclear power plants in the US in earthquake zones--as plenty of people did (including this site) based on a brief survey of Facebook--seemed painfully stretching the situation. Not to mention feeding into fears rather than addressing them constructively.

It's understandable that everyone was abuzz wondering what was happening, but you know what: Yesterday's Virginia earthquake was of approximately 1,000 times lower intensity than the one which struck Japan earlier this year, or the one which happened off Chile in 2010. It was 100 times less intense than the one which killed 68,000 people in Sichuan, China in 2008. It was roughly 10 times less intense than the one which ruined Haiti last year (a testament to better building codes here that more damage didn't occur I suppose).
