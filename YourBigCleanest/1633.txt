This is the same day that Prophet Owuor predicted an earthquake will hit the western world in the near future. The city will have tall skycraper buildings, it will be at night, The quake will last 42 secs and will break land so badly it will turn it in an anit clock wise position. This will be a﻿ sign from God. Repent! Jesus is coming. 

just an earthquake guys!Dont be afraid﻿ of..I see you re not quite used to in earthquakes..

@kjburger12 your thinking of the New Madrid fault near the Mississipi r. in1811 and 1812 there were 3 quakes in the 7.8 to8.2 magnitude. on the modified mercalli scale a measure of shaking intensity 1-12 it est they were @9-11 by comparison the 5.9 quake you felt was a﻿ 7. this quake might be a sign of more seismic on its way or could be a foreshck of a quake that that wont happen for 50-100 yrs. if the New Madrid goes off it wont be pretty.

@AnimalCrossing4ev Sorry for your lost. But﻿ i beleive this is a earthquake. And pretty soon a hurricane :(
