Is it possible that in using HAARP to try to steer hurricane Irene away from the eastern seaboard and minimize the potential for widespread catastrophic damage from what meteorologists say could come ashore as a monster category 4 hurricane—is it possible that the Virginia earthquake was accidentally induced? Extensive information available to the public implies the answer is yes.

As far as the Virginia earthquake being a product of HAARP, please learn more about this technology, and decide for yourself. There is great possibility that HAARP has already affected all of our lives in ways that seem incredible. 

They are steering the hurricane. However, it's not like steering a 300ZX and the storm can't be turned with pin point accuracy. If you look at a line from Alaska to where the hurricane was beginning to turn sharply, VA is right in the path.One huge point everyone is missing is that most cell service went out 6 hours prior to the earthquake within 250 miles of epicenter

My first though was that the unusual quake along our East Coast was somehow related to Japan's 9.0 earthquake. That quake shifted the position of Earth's axis by 6.5 inches. It had been 1200 years since a quake of this magnitude hit Japan's plate boundary.
