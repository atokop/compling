At approximately 2:00pm, a 5.9 magnitude Earthquake hit Virginia yesterday, Tuesday August 24th. Although it struck 300 miles away, the entire East Coast shook, including Jackson Heights, New York.

The epicenter of the earthquake was near Mineral, Virginia; about 85 miles outside our nation’s capital of Washington, DC.  According to an article posted by ABC WorldNews, “the pillars of the capital in Washington, DC shook. Alarms sounded in the FBI and Department of Justice buildings, and some flooding was reported on an upper floor of the Pentagon as a result of the quake.”

Queens residents spoke to the Queens Courier, reporting their experience with the quake. “I felt the earthquake. It was weird. I didn’t know what to do,” said Lisa Heron of Springfield Gardens. She added that she was “relieved when it stopped.” Another Queens resident from Bayside said he was “sure it was either construction or the train,” (Queens Courier).  

The last recorded earthquake to rattle the Northeast Coast was in November of 2010, when a minor 3.9 magnitude quake was detected off the coast of Long Island from Massapequa to East Hampton.
