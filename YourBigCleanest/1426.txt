														5.9 Virginia Earthquake

														D.C. Earthquake

A 5.8 magnitude earthquake shook Virginia on Tuesday afternoon and folks quickly uploaded footage of their experience, and the quake's immediate aftermath, to YouTube.

The epicenter, which was located in Mineral, Va., fell between Richmond and Charlottesville, south of the nation's capital. According to the USGS, the quake occurred at a depth of 3.7 miles.

Richmond's close proximity to the epicenter allowed many to feel the quake strongly, though at this point there doesn't seem to have significant damage.

				The terrifying video of the two dogs, reacting to the massive earthquake­, was enough to remind me of just how powerful an earthquake can be.  I'm glad that AOL took the liberty to make this video public and I hope that this will increase awareness of earthquake­s.  Great job, AOL!

				Technicall­y, one should NOT go outside during an earthquake­... From experience­, the power lines could fall, and in severe instances, the earth could open and close... Best bet is to stand in the doorway of the lowest level -- and have positive thoughts!

				A bit dramatic unless he was at the center of the earthquake­.  My sister lives down in that area and she said it was frightenin­g but nothing like this guy made it out to be.  We felt it here in Baltimore and it didn't last as long as his video did either.

				Hi, this is my video. We are about 40 miles from the epicenter of the earthquake­. I didn't add any drama or make it out to anything other than what it really was. The camera was sitting on a table so any movement seen was from the shaking of the house. We haven't had an earthquake like this since 1897, so it is a big deal to us.

				I was in Indian Head Maryland and for some reason it felt like it was stronger than your video. Not by much, but my stuff fell off my shelf and in my closet. It lasted that amount of time ,but,being me and my four year old weren't expecting it she started to cry and I just took her and ran out the house because I thought it was a 911 attack (originall­y from NY) or the world ending! lol I know I sound dramatic but if I was in CA maybe it wouldn't have been such a shock. She really was scared and starting screaming that the house was going to fall on us.Wouldn'­t want to go through that again! CA can have their earthquake­s! lol.
